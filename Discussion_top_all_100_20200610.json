It got to the point where she would try to tell me a story or something and I literally would make myself not believe her. Not sure if that\u2019s totally related to the couples pranking each other but I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about and it\u2019s terrible, I could never be with someone that did things like that.

It's relevant..."],"2":["IT WAS NEVER A DEBATE.\n\nI think most people get confused with they hear BLM. It was never about who mattered more. BLM is the present day Civil Rights Movement. Just like back in the day when CRM wasn't just about black people mattered more, we just wanted to be treated the same as our fellow Americans.\n\nMost of the time when the news report on these protests, it shows only the looting. But if you search through social media, you can find short videos of people defending various businesses in their community from the looting. Not everyone protesting with BLM agree with the looting. (In Flint, the sheriff of a community laid down his weapons and began walking with protesters. Something that probably won't be making rounds on the mainstream news)\n\nMost people get looters and rioters confused with what BLM stands for. It's nothing new, there are always a few bad apples in  a tree (not all cops are bad, not all white people are evil, not all black people are violent. Things like that.). Not matter how positive the movement is for an issue. \n\nThe ALM stemmed from misunderstanding of the BLM's theme.","The issue is the missing word. It's Black Lives Matter Too, not Black Lives Matter More.\n\nBLM TOO includes it in all lives matter, it's a recognition that they're in there.\n\nAll Lives Matter only makes sense if the unsaid word is more. (It's too)","Saying all lives matter when someone brings up BLM is like saying all cancers matter at a breast cancer run. We know they all matter but we\u2019re focusing on one in particular at the moment","All lives matter, blacks are a lot of the actual protesters so it makes sense they say black lives matter, as a black guy was on video being killed in the way he was.\n\nEverything has a narrative, and people just care about the BLM narrative.  That\u2019s all they see, or want to go crazy about.  They are the minority so naturally they do get stereotyped the most, and prejudiced.  White people just don\u2019t look for or care about whites being killed.  If we were the minority I\u2019m sure we would be and would be doing the same thing.","They don't hate it because it \"isn't focused on race.\" The problem is that if your house is on fire and you want to call the fire department, but then somebody gets offended and says \"all houses matter!\" Yes, all houses matter but this is where there is a problem at the moment. Does that make sense?","\nI absolutely believe George Floyd was murdered and that all those officers should be charged with murder. Police have too much power and not enough accountability in my eyes. \n\nMany are out there exclaiming that blacks are disproportionately killed by white cops. They exclaim that this is modern day slavery and racism is at the core of police in the US. I think this situation is so much more nuanced than that. I always like to look at statistics when things like this occur. I feel like the progressive voices (which I consider myself when it comes to most social issues and science) will shoot this down immediately. These are my genuine questions- \n\nIf black people make up 14% of the population and commit 52% of homicides doesn\u2019t it make sense that they would be killed at the hands of a police officer more often? Unarmed killings are inexcusable, but according to a study- \u201cwe don\u2019t find evidence for racial disparities, at least as tied to officer race. It\u2019s not the case that white officers seem to be primarily responsible for these shootings. But we\u2019re not at all trying to argue that the police are, say, free of racial bias. The data we have just don\u2019t answer that kind of question.\u201d This isn\u2019t the only research that shows that white officers aren\u2019t more likely to shoot black citizens. Last year, a study from Rutgers University found that \u201cwhite officers are no more likely to use lethal force against minorities than nonwhite officers,\u201d in the words of lead researcher Charles Menifield.\u201d For every black unarmed killing there are numerous white unarmed killings as well.\n\nAlso if the police force is inherently racist like neo-nazi racist, then why aren\u2019t East Asians, Indians, Muslims, Jews, and other minorities targeted by the police? These minorities actually have crime rates much lower than white people and hold more wealth than whites. If there was a systematic and governmental push to keep whites in power then why would these groups have higher incomes than whites? \n\nI also acknowledge that there are social and cultural reasons behind poverty and violence. This is my question regarding that-\n\nMany groups throughout history have experienced oppression. After the Holocaust, where 6 million Jews died and every possession was stolen from them, they rebuilt their lives and reintegrated into society. They didn\u2019t remain in poverty, and are now a very prosperous group. Chinese people faced terrible persecution in the late 19th century with the Chinese Exclusion Act and decades of other racist policies. The CEA was only repealed in the 1940s and they weren\u2019t able to become citizens until the 60s. However, Asian Americans now have higher incomes and higher attainment rates of secondary education than white people. When the Irish arrived in America they were heavily discriminated against, and referred to as savages. After a few generations the Irish were able to integrate into the middle class. Filipinos have a similar story with anti-Filipino sentiment in the early 20th century. Eastern Europeans had to deal with mccarthyism, many lost their jobs and some were accused of treason and imprisoned. It\u2019s important to note that every new group that arrives is usually discriminated against, but eventually moves into the middle\/upper classes after a generation or two. This is occurring in real time with Latino populations, as we see the first generation\u2019s education rates skyrocketing. So why is it that so many minority groups faced such adversity and racism, yet have vastly different trajectories than African Americans? How does slavery\/Jim Crowe still contribute to high crime, low education rates and high poverty? Muslims (specifically Arab Muslims) experience high levels of discrimination\/racism in the US, yet have very low crime rates, high income levels and high educational attainment. \n\nThese are questions I cannot ask without major backlash from people within my inner circle.","This is a bold topic but I know a lot of people probably think of this stuff more than admit to asking about it. Here are my thoughts:\n\n*First.. I am white..I am not racist, I do have bi-racial family members so I am seeing most of the struggle come from them. It hurt a little when my younger cousin in grade school told me that she is afraid to say BLM or All Lives Matter because she is worried of the reaction she will get ..being bi-racial. Which made me realize that ALM is about race. There are not many blacks who even want to say ALM, in my opinion .. (atleast I don\u2019t see it much anyway)\n\nI want to support BLM.. but at the same time I don\u2019t feel like the black race supports it themselves. They say it. But only when a white man kills a black man, what about when a black man kills a black man? This happens way more often and we ALL know it. But who brings it to attention? The older generation of blacks. I can\u2019t tell you how many times my uncle (black man) who is the deputy sheriff of my town, has stood in a crowd of black youths telling them to be the difference.  \n\nI am only 29. But I can tell you that I didn\u2019t grow up with the same fear I have now to walk outside at night. My parents didn\u2019t have that fear of letting us play outside in the dark or walk to our friends houses. We were raised to fear.. and in this case to fear the black man. I feel sometimes that our feared minds are used against us during certain circumstances. Which makes certain races feel superior. \n\nWe all just need to put our pitchforks down and go witness the wholesomeness of children, of all races, playing together outside on a playground and maybe go back to this mentality of love. \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc","So I also share an unpopular opinion here. I think the main problem is that the ALM movement came about mainly to counteract the BLM movement. Somehow this makes it racist. However, just because it's opposing the BLM movement doesn't mean the ideals are bad. They simply suggest that there is no real problem with inequality that needs to be addressed. This is very controversial and considered racist to say, but based on numbers and statistics it's true. I'm sorry if that hurts someone's feelings, but numbers and facts don't care about your feelings. They simply exist. I personally agree with the idea that all lives should be protected. I don't see any real difference or proof of inequality. Whether we like it or not, physical differences will always differentiate us and people will judge us in some way for that, and it will make things unfair. But that applies to literally any physical difference. If race doesn't matter, it shouldn't be a driving force here any more than other unfair advantages because of physical differences. I can't riot because statistically speaking I'm not considered attractive. I can't riot because I have a big head. I can't riot because I speak funny. I can't riot because I have blonde hair. These are all physical differences that could potentially make things unfair for me, but nobody cares about those. If race and color doesn't matter, then make it really not matter. Treat race and gender and everything else just like any other physical difference.","> I swear if I hear that burning house quote \n\nwhat is it?","> \u201ceverybody already believes that all lives matter this is about black people not you\" but do they actually believe it?\n\nExpand upon this. It\u2019s pretty much what I was going to say.","BLM","The \"Black Lives Matter\" slogan is a racist statement in and of itself and does absolutely nothing to further the cause of racial inequality in my opinion. it's laughable. two wrongs don't make a right.","Two Wrongs Don't Make A Right","All lives matter\u2014except for the lives of people who firmly hold obscene, narcissistic, snobby, sheeple, and hypocritical opinions.  So what if traumatic and horrific things happen to them?  They would\u2019ve deserved it, wouldn\u2019t they?","TL;DR: 10 times out of 10, when a person who believes systematic racism is a problem sees BLM, they go \"while there are many problems, this movement focuses on this problem, let's consider that problem\". So when one sees BLM and goes \"well that's a stupid name, what about other problems\", one is making a choice to refuse to consider systematic racism, and I don't understand why you would do that if you believe justice is important.\n\nI'd say the black lives matter movement is about something extremely complex and extremely important, but it needs a name that can't accurately reflect that. The movement is named the way it is because the participants felt like they were in a system that behaved like black lives were less important than white lives and wanted to call attention to that. Here's the point though: BLM is about something that I'm assuming we all, as reasonable people agree on: that systematic racism is a problem that needs to be fixed. And it's hard for me to understand how a reasonable person would look at the BLM movement and decide that what needs to be done is adress the imperfection of the name. I find it a little difficult to formulate, but the reasoning goes something like this: it's not racist to think that the movement is poorly named, but I don't see how a non-racist can see the movement and not engage with the message. ANY movement with a relevant following develops outliers, extremists, unwelcome guests, et cetera, but the movement is still about the issue of institutional racism in the US. And what ALWAYS happens is that those who disagree with the movement target the outliers for their criticism instead of engaging with the issue. So when one says BLM is a racist name or attack some other extremely superficial, irrelevant, or misrepresentative aspect of the movement, one is actively choosing to avoid the issue and work against solving the problem of institutional racism. \n\nBut dude, I get that it's super annoying to have legitimate concerns about complex subjects made light of in superficial memes, my advice is to stay out of echo chambers all together, but especially ones that echo sentiments you want to properly discuss","Bot not only white-owned business was vandalized, black ppl too, interesting how much more until black folks will rise against sloths of their race that live off welfare and just want to loot and cause chaos. \n\nThese kind of movements happened in Africa when black ppl just deported all white people, spoiler, nothing good resulted in that decision...There are also cities like Detroid in US for the sake of example.","Don\u2019t feed the troll."],"3":["I agree with u bro.","I was born and raised in Brazil and abortion isn\u2019t legal over there. However, when a woman feels the need to get an abortion for whatever reason she might have, she\u2019ll do it regardless of if it\u2019s legal or not, and because of this many women end up dying in the process. Abortion should NOT be banned, banning it is a violation of women\u2019s rights over their own body and also pushes them to take drastic measures to get what they want, which in this case would be a dangerous illegal abortion. Also, the regulations about abortion are normally made by men, which doesn\u2019t make sense at all because men shouldn\u2019t tell women what to do with their bodies.","Brave if you to post this. This topic always blows up online haha everybody\u2019s got something to say. \n\n100 agree with you. Bodily autonomy is very important and has to be protected. Abortions will happen whether it\u2019s legal or not. It\u2019s about safety.","I agree with you 100% and I'm glad you said it this way because I'm going to start framing it that way, too. \n\nI also ask pro-fetusers if they think children are punishments, and they always say no. And I say well you said that \"actions have consequences\" so to me that sounds like they see the child as a punishment which is a terrible terrible way to bring a child into the world. \n\nThen they argue adoption but the system, at least here in the US but I'm guessing probably everywhere, is already extremely overburdened and also a terrible situation to bring a child into. They're not thinking about the ultimate good of the women or the child, they're just emotionally going with their feelings and not thinking about it what so ever. Easy to do when it's not your problem!","The big nightmare enemies of abortion picture to my understanding is that abortion would become more and more prevalent to the point that some people would use it as replacement for contraception. And I would agree that abortions - while legal - should be kept rare for the most part. I don't think it's ethical to force anyone into parenthood given how poorly their children tend to evolve. But I also find it just sad when unwanted pregnancies happen.","The argument against is actually that;\nSince there is no clear point when a fetus becomes a human life, any limit to abortion is arbitrary, thus abortion is still up for debate when the child has passed puberty.\nSince we agree that a human life is a sacred thing, and since we can't draw a line between a human life and a \"cluster of cells\"  it is better to play it safe and consider it a human life from the point of conception.\n\nOften the trade made isn't between the mother's life and the child's life, but between the child and the convenience of the mother.\n\nIn the end what we we have to weigh is the whole dilemma of aborting children versus discouraging promiscuity and encouraging personal responsibility in regards to sex life.\nMost people figure that it is easier to just not have sex on whim than it is have to kill something potentially human.\nMany are onboard with abortion in life-or-death  situations for the mother or in cases where conception was involuntary.\n\nBasically, the pro-choice argument is: I should be able to do what I want with my life\nThe pro-life argument is: You can't infringe on another's life and your choice is your responsibility.","Actually I think abortion should be banned only for people who had \"accidental\" pregnancies.","My opinion is that abortion is wrong, I'm not against anyone doing what they want, but I see a fetus as a person, when insemination happens. It's hard to determine when exactly a fetus is a baby, what month, week, etc. One argument is the entire 9 months to allow abortion, but then when does the fetus become a baby, when it is pushed out, the umbilical cord is cut, idk. It's subjective to different people and I think the 1 way to distinguish is when the fetus has a unique set of DNA separate from the mother and father.\n\nI take exception to non-consensual sex but I think that instead of supporting abortion, we should set up a better adoption system to support giving kids that were given up on or otherwise have no parental figure a better chance. I think that the fetus is a separate body so I see it not as a woman doing what they want with their body, but what they are doing with another life.\n\nI again, have no problem with people doing what they want with their own body, but I see a fetus as a separate life, and since it will become a baby, I value it as one. I'm a libertarian and strongly hold the believe that people can do whatever the hell they want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else, but I see a fetus and that other person.",">And why does the paternal parent get off scott free in all of this? Why isn't he denied rights or punished for his part?\n\nWhy would the father be punished? They don't have a legal right to tell a woman to have or not have an abortion, so in what context would you punish them?... which is correct they cant determine if a woman can abort since its not their body. Your argument, here, is highly flawed, and looking for female privelage, a right without a responsibility.... lets somehow blame men\n\nThe fathers are already legally responsible in terms of money anyway for a child, even if they don't want the child. I.e. they have responsibility not a right. This is why young boys who are raped by 40 year old women who get pregnant are legally liable and forced to be tens of thousands in child support. Yes really, see my threads. In the USA and around the world. Also why sperm donor mothers area suing men for child support. Or why men who are proven not to be the fathers, and the court accept it, are forced to pay child support or got to jail, when the court SAYS IT KNOWS it a fraud case:\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UH9fnRnEcr0](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UH9fnRnEcr0)\n\nIm not taking a stance on abortion here, that is irrelevant to my argument. Your other flaw is your last argument, anybodys business? Well for starters you are telling women what they can and cant do with their body. The entire government and medical institutions business is other peoples body, they tell us what to do and decide what treatments are available and who gets what. Like all other procedures doctors perform they do have a say what they offer. Should doctors be compelled to perform entirely cosmetic surgery etc. Does a doctor have to give a womb transplant or IVF to a 80 year old female?\n\nYou OP is very gynocentric... women women women.

The more people who do come out, the more normal it will be seen as in society. That's why it's celebrated, each person who comes out as lgbt makes one tiny step towards that normalization. It's also worth celebrating because that person now feels comfortable enough to live as who they are among general society.","Being confused about what holes you have and what to do with them will never be normal for a mature adult.","Same sex marriage was only legalised within the decade in what is traditionally considered 'the west' and there is only really 1 maybe 2 generations alive in which prejudice against LGBT people is seen as a big no no.\n\nAs with everything, whenever a celebrity comes out you have to take into context each individual. For Philip Schofield, this is a man in his late 50s who has been married for nearly 3 decades, co-hosting one of the most popular morning shows in the UK, so his coming out would've been news regardless. Then, once its public I'd rather the media celebrate it than berate it. \n\nHopefully we can get to a point where people dont really think about it but consider the fact that there are only 28 countries where same sex marriage is legal and 73 where being gay is flat out criminal, let alone the social stigmas that still exist. It's a matter of personal opinion as to where you draw the line, but I don't think that society has progressed enough to where attention won't be drawn to it, so that attention should at least be positive.","I don't think we should celebrate it. I'm lgbt myself and I don't understand the point of it in areas where we have full recognition and rights. Why is who I fuck or kiss or like something to be proud of? Pride is reserved to achievements or qualities to outshine other qualities. Who is in my bedroom certainly is nothing for a celebratory reason nor something to be praised","Alternatively, we do typically celebrate when heterosexual people get married, or have a baby, or adopt. There are some life events that are just worth celebrating because they're a big deal.\n\nIf that's true, the real question is if coming out is an event of that nature. That may actually depend on the individual and their situation.\n\nI think we also need to separate the event itself from the collective motivations behind the people reacting. People seem to enjoy using events like this to proclaim their own virtue, a little bit in-person, but way more on the internet. I can't help but think a lot of the internet celebration over celebrities coming out is basically the same as the internet mourning when a celebrity dies. A lot of social media posts turn into a competition: \"You all think yourselves so progressive\/empathetic\/woke, when in fact it is Iiiii who am the progressivest\/empatheticest\/wokest.\" And in response, there are a lot of other people who go so far as to condemn that reaction, and are probably reacting to the vanity and self-glorification of it rather than the actual sentiment, but come across as callous.","LGBT people are stupid as shit","Homosexuality comes as a result of reincarnation.

People have even been kicked out of their parent\u2019s house for coming out. When I came out, it was scary because I was afraid of how my dad would react.

Everyday, we should applaud for those who come out because what they need when they do come out is support. To answer this, yes and no.

I also think that this applies to certain celebrations like pride month and black history month. In order to incorporate, truly, these sexuality and history in everyday society, we need to dissolve it in order to incorporate it into the system. It's necessary in order to gain support by the masses, but eventually it needs to be dissolved so they aren't elevated too high.\n\nFor example, black history month has been celebrated for years and I know it might be a little heated considering the events that has happened recently, but I would say that racism has largely been dealt with, at least for most people, and the next step might be to dissolve black history month and just incorporate it into american history. If we stop learning about black leaders in this one month or just pay attention to the LGBTQ+ community in one month, we subconsciously forget about them all other times of the year. I would say that we don't learn enough about black history and to learn an adequate amount, which I think would further discourage racism, is my normalizing it into the entire year.\n\nRight now I would say that it is a little early to dissolve pride month since to a certain extent, it is still taboo, especially to some religious communities and the older generation for example, but I think it would be beneficial to start the process of taking a step back with forcing attention to the LGBTQ+ community.","I have to applaud you for posting one of the best. , honest, real discussion topics in a long time here.\n\nUnfortunately, given the stigma and idiocracy of the way Society is handling people who make choices or want to claim that they are something that was forced on them, I am theoretically not allowed to comment without being called a hater, because I'm straight, white, and male.

No, whites should not be expected to apologize, unless they realize that they have taken part in unfair treatment in some way. We see the actions of one person, and with mob mentality, this creates a separation and perceived causation. This creates a public outrage blaming an entire group of people or even the entire country. What will take a while to understand is that the actions of one person do not define an entire group of people. The reality is there is no amount of whites participating in protests, renouncing white privilege publicly, public apologies, etc. that will fix what has happened. \n\nNone of this helps when you have the media driving their political agendas when they choose what stories to cover and what they say. It doesn't help when they want everything to be about racism, except when it really is and it's racism against a white population (referring to the extreme anti-Semitism that the media shows by simply not covering or denying these cases of even happening, even though they include mass shootings of synagogues and terrorist attacks and very clearly racist actions). \n\nI think the answer to your question depends on what political side you agree with. There is no arguing that the media, therefore the media coverage, therefore the voice on all of these situations, are controlled by the left. From this point of view, the country is at blame for not addressing the racism issue as well as it should because everyone is a racist, unless you're a minority, in which case are incapable of racism. If you align more with the right wing, then you think all of this is silly because of the coverage we have on the situation and how that makes the public go crazy, despite the lack of evidence of inequality and racism in general in the country. \n\nFrom my perspective on the situation, politics aside, I think we still have to wait for an official investigation and decision to condemn anything, but assuming it was police brutality which it definitely seems to be, this should be addressed and the officer should go to prison. Academies should probably have a better training process to prevent this from happening in the future. However, I see no evidence of this being related to racism. While it very easily could be, we simply lack the evidence as of now. If it turns out to be racism, the prison sentence should be extended. Assuming all of that happens, does that mean the country is to blame? No. Does that mean every white person (and only white people) is a racist? No. Does that mean we all need to apologize for the actions of one man? No. \n\nI think the issue with what is going on is the fact that it's mob mentality being controlled by the left. Any situation of mob mentality prevents people from looking at anything objectively. It doesn't matter what kind of evidence you give them, they will refuse to see it. It doesn't matter if evidence comes out suggesting that this was not murder, the public will still be controlled by mob mentality and will not care about the evidence.","Would you ask of the german children to apologize for what their grandparents did to the jews?

I'm not only talking about people discriminating against racial minorities, but also the minorities seeing their whole life through the lens of their race (and possibly even some associated stereotypes). Racists discriminating against minorities is still a problem, but it's one that gets addressed quite a bit. Racial minorities treating themselves as second-class citizens is no better, but is a little more complicated to address.\n\nUltimately, it's not so much \"racism\" that's the problem, but \"race\". There are certainly some pretty appalling correlations between race and important features such as education, income, crime etc. However, correlation does **not** imply causation - which is where people often get tripped up. It turns out, there is an insignificantly weak causal link between \"race\" and most of the questions we care about (except for very few, highly specific medical subjects like \"chance of getting a sunburn\").\n\nAmerican culture, in big part due to its history, is rather obsessed with the concept of \"race\". Some want to celebrate it, and, unfortunately, many still use it to discriminate. I say hang the whole concept of \"race\" - it's caused us nothing but trouble, and it's not useful for making good decisions (where causation is what matters).","It's not just racism. There is also poverty and perceived disenfranchisement.  The people rioting believe they have no influence on governments at all levels that do nothing for them except tax them and pay white policemen.  So, when something like a black man murdered by a white policeman happens, there is no redress.   \n\nThe rioters know they aren't going to change anything by torching businesses.  They are just enjoying a few desperate hours of feeling powerful and getting some of theirs back in a world where they are at all other times utterly powerless.  \n\nThe black population isn't the only group that feels that way.  It is also poor desperate white Americans who see their city, state and federal governments controlled by rich white people.  It was they who voted for Trump, seeing him as an outsider scorned by the elite, and therefore someone who would shake things up in Washington on their behalf.\n\nAll of this is underlain by an peculiarly American concept that if government helps people, with free medicine or unemployment insurance for example, this will somehow sap the moral fiber of the nation, and make America weak.  If you are poor, it is presumed to be because you just haven't tried hard enough, so you don't deserve government support.  Even many impoverished Americans believe this.  Unions are also seen as enemies of national greatness, because they ask for workers' benefits that workers are not thought to deserve, like being dismissed only for cause, or forcing the employer to pay them more, which is bad for free enterprise and reduces available jobs. \n\nThe fact that most other free, prosperous nations do everything differently with notable success just doesn't seem to register in the USA. \n\nNow, to be fair, there are a great many US citizens - some of them politicians - who don't believe this national mantra, understand the weaknesses of the system, and want change.  But they are fighting deeply-rooted values, and I have little hope that things will change.","I think you\u2019re absolutely right.

I understand why people are protesting but in all reality it won't create change, I doubt politicians will be convinced, they've solved the symptom by arresting the cops who killed George Floyd, but the disease is the law enforcement. If governors pay more attention to making sure officers are competent and held responsible, the problem will be lessened extensively. The way that happens is by putting someone in office who is willing to make that change though, and I don't think that will happen unless politicians truly address the source of the problem and suggest a proper solution.","I'll tell you what racism has to do with it:  It's the *cause* of racism.","Couldn't agree more.

If you have an opinion and you feel that it is well-formed, based on factual information, and it's something you want to express and defend, then don't be afraid of what the others say. Be open to adjust it if you learn stuff you didn't know, obviously. You don't want to be just stubborn. Own up to when you are wrong. Other advice is to own up to what you say when you believe it.

I have been downvoted to hell for some of my unpopular opinions (the worst weren't even serious topics, not sure why everyone was specifically butthurt about it). If it's something you believe in, stick with it. Don't delete it. If you feel strongly about it, own up to it even if you get downvoted to hell.

It was somehow screenshotted and sent to people on twitter, where they just bullied her for saying looting was wrong. She advocated for BLM on twitter and they were calling her a hypocrite and implied she was racists for agreeing with looting, even though it was just a completely valid opinion. I like liberal policies but the groupthink is just crazy. People who genuinely are not racist and care about the cause are being shunned because they don't think like everyone else, and it's pushed me towards the right because somehow if you don't support looting, you are labelled a racist. It's insane.","The one that gets me is \"let's stop pretending this issue is really about x when really it's about y\" insert narrative about control, hate, oppression, etc.\nE.g. \"let's stop pretending pro-lifers care about foetuses when they really just want to control women's bodies\" or, conversely, \"let's stop pretending pro-choicers care about women's rights when it's really about being selfish\"\nRendering an argument this way is reductive and intellectually dishonest.","I completely agree this is happening; however, I do not think it is widespread.

When you decide to engage in any discussion, whether it be professional, personal, or general public, it is your responsibility to weather the shift or change in that discussion, whether it be aggressive, passive, or non-productive in nature.

A person with little positive interaction with black people could easily see negative actions of a select few (and negative actions are always more prominently shown by media than positive ones) and they will draw conclusions and links that all black people must be like this. If your mother was a person of colour you would never be racist against black people because you have a great example of a good person to stop those negative conclusions.\n\nRacism is a misguided fear that people develop, except when you fear dogs or spiders the dog doesn't ask you why you hate them, you never say aloud that your hate is because it is a dog and not a cat. With racism your fear and hate starts to harm others far more than your fear of spiders could.\n\nIf you seperated a group of people into males and females and let them live with very little interaction it wouldn't take much for people to start to hate the other group.

The boy would fear all women and start to hate them for just being a female. \n\nIt sucks that this kind of thing happens and it's nobody's fault that racism is a thing, but I think we need to learn to accept that some people are racists and they need help, a racist should not be in law enforcement just like a person afraid of dogs wouldn't be a vet or work for an animal rescue shelter. Racism to me is a fear that's turned to hate and to get rid of racism we need to help teach people not to fear. Of somebody admitted to you that they are a racist you should work to help them and learn to accept all people for who they are, introduce them to a friend that you know is kind and caring to help them overcome their racism.\n\nThat doesn't mean that it is an excuse or a reason to let others off from crimes they commit, but its not enough for all lives to just matter, all lives need to be cared about which includes racists. Rather than shun somebody and attack them, help them  to overcome the issue and be a better person. The murder of George Floyd is a murder plain and simple, his killer should not be given any leniency but just because somebody self consciously crosses the street when a black person comes the other way, doesn't mean they should be given the same punishment.","I agree.  It doesn't matter how many statues you take down or how many laws you pass or how much special treatment you give to a certain group...people will still have opinions and act on them.","That\u2019s bullshit that racism still exists.

The law is the law. Stealing someone else property just because you \"need it more\" is still stealing. Obviously everybody should eat and I'm not saying they starve, but letting them steal is not the solution.","There are better ways to help someone I mean yes you are providing them food but still you are telling them it\u2019s ok to steal. It\u2019s not ok to steal at all. And if you set it in their mind that\u2019s it\u2019s ok to steal something like food then they\u2019ll probably move on to stealing items that have value.

If i was a judge I would probably go easier on someone who was homeless and stealing food, but then again it would also depended on what they were stealing. Someone who is stealing a loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter I would be more likely to over look then i would be someone who was stealing steaks.

Which I can't complain about too much for -my- part, I don't mind paying a bit more so others can enjoy some decent food too. That being said, there are food pantries and soup kitchens in many places that help such people, there is a program in place here in America to help people in need purchase food. But soup kitchens and food pantries also don't always have the best quality food, and around here, many times when I see people getting donated food, it's -extremely- expired. And the food assistance program (whatever they're calling it these days, I can't keep track anymore) is -constantly- under attack by Republicans, so relying on that is frankly terrifying. I realize I'm going back and forth here so basically to sum it up, I don't mind if they feel like they need to steal from those who can afford the loss, but I feel like we can and should do better, as a society, for those in need so that they don't feel like they need to steal at all. At the risk of delving too far into the political weeds, even the most hard-hearted Conservative should have the sense to realize that when we help those in need, regardless of -why- they're in need, or who is to blame for their situation, we reduce strain on the system. We reduce crime, we reduce healthcare costs, we reduce many costs that we will, sooner or later, unavoidably end up paying as a society, and we leave people better off to make something of themselves and give back to society if and when they decide to do so. Some will never give back, but we're going to be paying for them and their actions somehow, may as well go with the options that tackle problems when they can be solved with, say, a sandwich and a cheap apartment, instead of paying for emergency medical care, a prison, and guards to keep them there.","I agree with your boyfriend.

Where does it stop? \u201cHe had to bike to work, so he stole a car from the local dealership, let him have it, he needs it.\u201d\n\u201cHe was starving and $50,000 in debt, so he robbed a bank and stole $100,000, let him have it.\u201d\n\nI am of the stance that stealing is stealing, it does set a precedent if you are okay with this kind of stealing, but not that kind. Who is going to decide who \u201cdeserves to steal\u201d and who doesn\u2019t? Someone busts in and grabs something, you\u2019re supposed to turn into a counselor in this tense moment and softly talk to them like \u201cexcussssse me, do you reallllly need that? Because if you do, you can havvvvve it.\u201d Of course they are going to say yes even if the answer is \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\nSociety and order is built off of basic decency like \u201cdon\u2019t steal, don\u2019t Murder,\u201d if we start allowing these things we go back to tents and caves.

How about we analyze your salary, decide you make \u201cgood money,\u201d and start raiding your fridge, taking \u201cjust a sandwich\u201d everyday? How\u2019s that? How about again, the precedence? The fact that if it\u2019s okay for this homeless guy to take a sammich, then 10 of them, then 50, come do it *everyday*, who is allowed to take stuff and who is not? Whoever is dirtiest and who you decide \u201cneeds it most\u201d? Let\u2019s say the law forced the business to let 50 homeless individuals take sammiches everyday. You\u2019re telling me this wouldn\u2019t hurt the business?? It\u2019s really easy to tell someone else it\u2019s \u201cno problem\u201d to let others *steal* from them. It\u2019s not you so, no problem right? Then 1,000 homeless people show up outside that supermarket everyday for the daily giveaway. Taking shit, hurting the business. Pissing, shitting everywhere. Biohazard. Camping out for their daily free meal. It becomes a mad house. No one wants to wade through the toxic sludge to shop there anymore. Great, the business is now closed due to the literal robbing it has to endure, plus the destruction of the local property. Where does it stop? There is a reason for laws. You like going outside and having an orderly world, where you feel safe and can guarantee your supermarket stays open, as do I. The road you\u2019d like to go down is a road that leads us somewhere else. The laws were put in place to drag us *out* of caves and tents. Again, if you want to live that life, you\u2019re welcome to, and you won\u2019t have to worry about supermarkets anymore because it\u2019ll be berries you find and animals you like, skin, cook, etc from then on.","\"Allowed\"... no...","Stealing is morally wrong. But if your desperate for food and your stealing from a huge corporation that is filthy rich it can be understandable.

Like go into a store and \u201crob it\u201d by asking for a 20 dollar bill and wait for the police to come. You get a roof over your head, food everyday, and you get showers. \n\nMinimum security prison is not as bad as it seems, and if you explain why your in there I\u2019m sure everyone would treat you better.

With extremely cold winters, and hot, humid summers, working and playing outside would determine what I ate and in what quantities. Being called pudgy in the winter and anorexic in the summer are not worth listening too when being extremely active outdoors in such varying weather conditions required constant adjustments to diet and hydration. Only you know what body type is appropriate for your activities. You are your own best judge of where you should be, in regards to body type and image.","As you grow older you learn certain things about life that kinda changes your whole perspective.    \nI know what is like to be skinny, having a fast metabolism where fat gets burned easily.

Eating a nutritious breakfast that gives you strength and then , eat in the middle of the day , lunch , afternoon ,dinner and before bed.

They create pollution by blocking roads. They leave the sites of protests a massive mess. The real problem is that they don't care, but they _think_ they care.\n\nIt's all a part of year long brainwashing. I'm not even kidding. Media and officials have told us over and over what we need to do to \"save the planet\". People believe it and people repeat it, even if it's not really to save the planet. It's not about doing good. It's about showing others how good you are doing. Virtue points. \"Look at me I'm amazing.\"\n\nThat is why, as soon as we get to a point where media has not made a huge point out of it, nobody cares. Nobody is shaming them for leaving a mess, instead they get spotlights for being protestors. Nobody wants to give up their car, so we ignore it and nobody cares. It's because nobody actually cares! Except for how other perceive them.","I guess some people would think pollution wouldn't bother them in their lifetime too much so its not a big issue to them.

The country is a monument that was built on slavery and oppression. I guess that's why people attack the flag, but the flag never did anything wrong.

As if hiding our history from ourselves will improve our ability not to repeat it.\n\nIt's deep stupid.","I believe the best way to approach this is to what extent should we. If it blatantly supports racist like a statue of hitler or a swastika then clearly remove it. if it\u2019s about a historic figure who owned a slave, but was known for something else then it should be removed it should be preserved.\n\nDestroying things that only represent the issue or portray it positively is understandable. if it represents a different topic but has a connection to racism, then it isn\u2019t about racism it is about whatever it is representing. \n\nRacism is unfortunately one of the shitty things Humans have done and continue to do. And like all history we should acknowledge our mistakes and learn from them, not hide them and forget so history can repeat itself","I generally agree with taking down statues that honor former slave owners or glorify slavery in any way. Glorifying such horrific behavior has no place in today's society. I'm not concerned with the Egyptian pyramids as they don't reside in the US.

Because of the reasons below, I would still hope for a better solution to their problem than dismantling the pyramids (nvm the fact that that's just not happening).\n\n2. The pyramids are much less relevant than these statues. Statues of people who were terrible in the last 200 years have a real effect on the people who see them every day. I find it hard to believe that someone finds a personal connection to the suffering (possibly) caused by the building of the pyramids. \n\n3. Statues are, by their nature, glorifications. I don't think one can ignore central aspects of a person, even though he is commemorated for something else. I'd suggest a tribute to Churchill's pen, or weapon, or something else to commemorate his hand in defeating nazi Germany, not a statue to the whole man, when the whole man was seriously (not marginally) flawed. Glorify actions, events, decisions, not people who has caused the world considerable injustice (even if they did something great).","Those are not related or comparable in any way so I don't get the argument.","Not one kid in America is looking at a statue and asking his dad \"Who was he papa?\". They're irrelevant. You know what every statue should be called? \"Motherfucker on a horse\". Only people who put ketchup on hot dogs give a shit about statues. Their opinions don't matter","Very few great men and no great nations are without blemish.  It is irrational to deface a statue to a historic figure honored in his time for pursuits that the majority of his countrymen and all of his social class regarded as justified in his time.

One can imagine the reaction of England if a mob pulled down Nelson's Column, but even the most sympathetic historians agree his treatment of his wife was abominable.  \n\nThe lesson here is not to erase the memory of accomplishments of the past, but to be careful of what accomplishments, national or individual, we choose to honor.  \n\nThere should be a practice not to erect memorials sooner than a century after the event occurred or the individual died.  If still considered worthy, the inscription should take care to highlight what laudable accomplishment is memorialized.  By that standard, it would not be Nelson at the top of the column, but figures of ordinary sailors, 1500 of whom died with him at Trafalgar, many of them pressed into service, along with thousands of French and Spanish."],"49":["Or college should be tuition free and an opportunity for anyone who takes the time and effort needed to get in.

Child nudity isn\u2019t automatically illegal in and of itself, otherwise things like innocent pictures of babies taking a bath, or movies where child nudity is incidental to the plot would be illegal. What IS illegal is either 1.) sexual acts, or 2.) \u201clascivious displays of the genitals\u201d. What That basically means is that the image was posed or intended to be titillating to viewers. It\u2019s kind of a legal gray area.\n\nHowever, the question of whether child nudity is against YouTube policy is unclear to me. I believe that It might be allowed under very narrow constraints. For instance I think that one of those ultra-liberal Scandinavian countries posted a sex-Ed video on YouTube that included nudity of both children and adults, and while it was controversially it was allowed. However that was years ago now. As other people have stated, your best bet is to report it to YouTube, just to be safe.

People see anonymity as an opportunity to be the unlikable person they wouldn't have the courage to be in real life.\n\nI've seen bad jokes with 30x the downvotes of a genuinely racist comment. Every time you post an emoji you get downvoted to hell. Every time people see a comment with 0 or less upvotes they downvote by reflex, just because they like to gang up on someone. I'm beginning to understand why Google decided not to show thumbs down on YouTube comments, this system it only encourages hate.\n\nAnd the fact that Reddit is a fairly closed community that hates \"normies\", which literally means \"normal people\" doesn't help.\n\nTL;DR: internet = sense of anonymity = people can be their true selves.","Everyone thinks their opinion is gold without realizing life is subjective.","I think people saying their opinion and stating that it is their opinion and not the right thing is fine but you are right on how people think that their opinion is always right","Well, because they either violated the \"Internet-culture\", committed a most disgusting, scummy, and lowest offense, or they're just delusional fools.","There are many pieces to this puzzle, so I\u2019ll mention them one by one. \n\nPart of the issue is the \u201cold guard\u201d mentality: that is the idea that those who came before know better than those who came to reddit later. Whether it is maintaining the sanctity of particular subreddits or reddit in general, anyone who subscribes to the belief reddit should be protected from \u201ccorruption\u201d will tend to be toxic towards newcomers. \n\nPart of the issue is \u201cpurists\u201d: that is to say those who believe reddit should and does serve a particular function. Purists tend to argue from a barely hidden political, theological, or moral soapbox. They are toxic because they see the alteration of reddit from their particular viewpoint as active manipulation and corruption. \n\nPart of the issue is trolls. People who enjoy creating drama between others simply because it is enjoyable to them. \n\nPart of the issue is people with \u201cvalid\u201d agendas, who see reddit as a soapbox to be monopolized or capitalized on. Political, theological, moral, philosophical, logical, illogical, and completely insane positions that should and \u201cneed to be\u201d professed and lauded. \n\nPart of the issue is the nature of the internet itself, granting \u201cabsolute\u201d anonymity while also granting a platform to share and promote viewpoints no matter the moral \/ philosophical \/ theological issues inherent with those views. \n\nPart of the issue is people considering the opinions of complete strangers who claim professional \/ political \/ theological \/ moral standing. Just because someone claims to be an expert in a field doesn\u2019t mean Abraham Lincoln warned us against the dangers of the internet. \n\nPart of the issue is people being overly sensitive. Just because a troll or group of trolls decides to slam your inbox doesn\u2019t mean your opinion is invalid or that those opinions should be respected. Every individual should do their own research, form their own opinions, be open to correction or argument, and seek to establish the most sound knowledge possible. \n\nFinally part of the problem is the pervasive notion that somehow reddit is a unique community on the internet populated by sane, rational, intelligent humans. It isn\u2019t. It never has been. The internet is populated by humanity, and every public community is subject to trolls, assholes, entitlement, idiocy, intelligent discourse, political \/ theological \/ moral arguments.","The Reddit format encourages this behavior in those who have a problem with it.

What were they met with? Rubber bullets and tear gas. Yet when conservatives protest a literal pandemic and walk around with their guns out screaming in the faces of officers, storming government buildings, nothing happens. Key difference is, those protestors were majority white. So i think the discussion should be \"Why are they becoming violent\" not \"Are they going too far\". Violence insights violence. When police murder members of a demographic whether it be while they are selling CDs, walking home with skittles, playing cops and robbers, or just getting a normal speeding ticket, you bet your ass people are going to say enough is enough and try to make change. But when the peaceful requests for change is slandered (kneeling for anthem), and peaceful protests of the injustice that minorities are facing from those who are supposed to protect them are met with tear gas and rubber bullets, there's only so much peaceful change one can try to bring. It sucks, as businesses who did no harm are suffering, but what sucks more is being murdered because of the color of your skin. So, in my opinion, no. They haven't gone too far. This is what was bound to happen when an entire government disregards the unlawful actions of the police force that the taxpayers themselves pay for.","It\u2019s the result of many generations and hundreds of years of anger, do I think setting fires and such is too far, of course, but I understand where it comes from. America was built on protest, and even if a person doesn\u2019t want that extreme levels, this is human nature","I totally can understand the anger towards the incident that occurred - I think it was horrific - and what that represents to many people. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with protests occurring given what happened was appalling and it\u2019s not the first time incidents such as this have happened. \n\nHowever, I think a potential second category of people who ARE in the wrong are those who join in the protests not to protest in the name of the cause, but solely to cause trouble be it violence, theft, vandalism or anything of the sort. This goes for any protest or event however, not just this one. My point is, the demographic of people really going too far are those turning up with the mentality of causing trouble under the guise of protest. I think a lot of negatively opportunistic people use situations like this to act out their more violent tendencies or desires and that\u2019s totally unacceptable. \n\nThat being said, I do think this category of people are far outnumbered by those simply wishing to get across their message that they\u2019re unhappy with what has happened and tired of nothing ever happening to cease such tragic incidents. That\u2019s my take on the situation, as an outsider to the country, let alone community.","Protests always seem to go too far, no matter how just the initial cause. A mob is prone to turn protest into blind vengeance, hurt the innocent, and ironically dredge up sympathy for those being protested against.","From an outsiders prospective (not living or citizen) I do believe that all the lives lost due to police brutality are really heartbreaking and it shows the wrong mentality police force have about individuals of color and their should be an overhaul of the entire system, with new education for people who are involved in the police, and also a much more strict and non lenient punishment for officers who commit a horrible act. On the side of protesters, this is just driving a wedge between them and the lawmakers in the states, driving fear in the community is not the answer, people who do such acts as robbing and stealing from stores are really hijacking the real issue here, maybe some good will come out of this, but at what cost for the stores the local businesses.\nPs: I can never put myself in the shoes of people who\u2019ve been hurt by this, as I stated before this is just an outsiders prospective who really loves America, hope everyone is safe and healthy over there","Yes. Burning buildings, looting stores, vandalism, and destruction of the city that causes millions of dollars in damages is too far. Why can\u2019t people protest peacefully.... violence doesn\u2019t solve violence, it hurts your cause and creates divide","Obviously.  The riots are making exactly the opposite point, that the perpetrators only understand force.","Does anyone really think they haven\u2019t gone too far?  They are destroying and looting properties.\n\nThose police officers have been fired and the one will almost undoubtedly be convicted for murder of some kind.  It is never ok for these kinds of \u201cprotests,\u201d but at least don\u2019t start them until if those cop(s) are let off.","Tbh this whole situation gets me so angry. I feel like these riots are creating a bigger divide between the races. Most people in the country even most police officers were all in agreement that what happened to George Floyd was wrong. There was no defence of the officers actions it was a time of unity for everyone to speak as one and demand for charges to be put on the officer. I had a glimmer of hope that blue lives matter and black lives matter would actually agree on something and then people started burning and looting at random for no reason and completely shattered all hopes of everyone agreeing on something. That's why I hate what happened. Now you have racist black people saying bad things about white people and vice versa. These riots didn't hurt racism they've pushed it further. The only good thing that came out of it was the officer being charged.","I would love a civil discussion on it.\n\nMy opinion is that I'm obviously against it. My town is planning a protest tonight, which seems inevitable at turning into a riot with ample destruction of property. Who's that going to help? How many local business are going to get their shit smashed and vandalized when they're already struggling under COVID? Even if it's a big business. Why are they being punished? Why are you fighting unfairness with more unfairness? But I'm trying to understand it and bridge the gap into some middle ground. \n\nMy first rumination of course, and the one I hear all the time to condone it, is that this is just the venting of pent-up frustration. Which is understandable and partly true, but I'm not satisfied with this reasoning. In fact, I think that rationalization does a disservice to the people who's plight we're supposed to be empathizing with. To explain that these people, when they find themselves in hardships, however unfair and unjust, it's their nature that under such frustrations they devolve into a violent mob? And even if you do, yell and scream, break some bottles, set off fireworks, but then what's with the looting? Like obviously ruining someone's livelihood who had nothing to do with it looting?\n\nI especially dislike explanations of \"No one hears them any other way, so why not just get extreme?\". Sure I agree that sometimes progress seems slow, the fact that we have racial problems still today seems archaic. But this is a horrible explanation. I agree it hurts the cause. Yeah it gets people talking about the issues, but not in a good way. It's because, frankly IMO, it's easy. You get a night or two of chaos and high emotions and then that's it. And you get to say you did something meaningful because it was all over the news. I disagree. \n\nReal change is possible, but it takes a longer and committed effort. Campaigning, voting, neighborhood\/community associations to have a unified power and political voice to influence local politics. I've seen it happen. It's not quick, but it does work. I don't mean to sound patronizing, I know this is all a lot of time commitment, which is in itself a resource that the impoverished often are short on, and the frustration that it's happening very slowly is a valid complaint. What I'm only trying to get across is that the rationalizing of rioting as \"it puts eyes on the issues\" feels flimsy to me. There are better ways of outputting that energy if that is the crux of the need to riot.\n\nTrevor Noah put up a video which hits a different angle. Society is a contract, where we agree to abide by certain rules and morals, under the assumption that justice and fairness will be adhered to, at least with an honest effort if not perfectly at all times. When you try to follow this social contract, but see it violated by the other side again and again, and what's worse, blatantly violated by those who are supposed to be the arbiters of justice, the people we give extra powers to under the responsibility of using those powers to uphold the social contract.. Then it's frustration at the general situation yes, but more than that, it's a frustration of why are we following the social contract? \n\nWhich I think hints more at why they lash out in the ways they do (not to justify it, but give a better motive). It's not that they're robbing that shop to get at that specific owner or because they're just so angry they're lashing out at any fellow humans (I mean in a sense maybe, but not directly for this reason). It's an outburst against the social contract not being applied to others, so we're going to have some catharsis by not applying it to ourselves for a night. \n\nI don't know how much I agree this is exactly the case, but I like it way better than the usual explanation. And again none of this is to condone the rioting and looting, but I think it gives a better perspective of why it's happening in a way that doesn't simply the problem as \"They're just angry!\", which is too easy to distort into bad conclusions about said peoples.","Im an actual resident of Minneapolis.

Then again, I don't see the appeal of watching someone else play a video game when I could be playing one myself, so I suppose I'm not the best person to argue that point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that being said, it's important to remember that humor is subjective. I'm a quarter Cherokee, and was raised with as many associated values and beliefs as my mother could teach me on her own. I was raised in mostly white communities though, so I never fit in. I was constantly mocked, and people constantly said or did things thinking they were being funny, when in fact it was the same thing I had heard a thousand times before. It wasn't funny or original, it was irritating hearing it day after day after day, especially since most of it was based on false assumptions and incomplete knowledge. That constant needling made me a very angry, mistrustful child with few friends, and even as an adult I get pretty angry if I hear a white person slap their mouth while shouting, or do a stereotypical \"Indian\" voice. As it is I have to bite my tongue when I see older guys at work watching Bonanza in the break room. I know they don't mean any harm by it, and it's just a product of it's time, but that show is incredibly racist, and probably fed into a lot of the \"jokes\" I heard growing up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is simply that yes, some people do take things to extremes and clearly just want attention, but some people have legitimate reasons for not finding something amusing. Some people, like myself, don't really care what you and your buddies find funny in private, we just don't want it unexpectedly getting waved in our faces no matter where we go or what we do. In the privacy of my own home, I expect to be safe, I expect to be able to finally relax.","As much as I despise the snowflake mentality, I stopped reading at the first half sentence since you literally contradicted yourself.","Yeah, a society where you have to walk on eggshells your whole life sounds like a dystopia.

African countries, as well as middle eastern and to some extend also some south\/south-east-asian countries still have ongoing slavery. Sometimes it gets camouflaged by giving some sort of salary, that is literally just a symbolic payment.\n\nAlso, the market in human trafficing has risen in the past decade epecially towards arab and asian countries. Sex trafficers introduced african woman in the thai sex industry, because of the demand to offer more variety. (yes, it sounds simple, but thats the reason, sadly).\n\nWhen it comes to \"the shame of slavery\" the US has a unique stand point. Because of its history and the amount of post-slave-ethnicities living now within the US, while still being targeted as third degree humans (spanish are second), while not having a majority or an equal amount in political and economical key positions. (Italians were second degree too, until they needed their votes and made them \"White\" lol).\n\nIn comparison: some of the caribbean countries also consist of a almost only post-slavery population but got left (almost, they still have a UK governor, so a bit dictatorship-ish) on their own and they were able to create their identity and combine cultural background into that (ex. jamaica). Economically they have been sucked into that North American Trading Deal and are currently slaughtered by the US.\n\nEurope has a different kind of racism. In no language the word race gets even used in a day to day language (But english). Europeans speak of ethnicities, backgrounds and \"foreigners\", because of Fascism (Hitler and stuff and his \"perfect race attempt\") and because there are so many colours in europe since always. People get divided by nationalities and cultural groups. So it is a different discrimination than in the US.\n\nBy no means i want to say it is \"better\" or \"worse\". It is just different. It is different in china, in japan, in south asia.\n\nOne major point is, that what in the US is considered far left, is equal to centralism in the rest of the world. Leftism in Europe for example, is so far left it doesn't exist in the US. The right parties in the US would be considered extremist right parties in the rest of the world.\n\nOngoing discussions about discrimination because of ethnicity beside the US are south africa, Italy, spain and greece, Malaysia, Australia (as some examples). Italy now has 50% europeans, 20% Africans, 20% Asians and 10% American (continent). A total of 15% \"Foreigners\".\n\nWhereas the US has (seemingly) 72% \"white\", 16% Hispanic, 12% \"black\".\n\nAnd here is another difference. Once that african woamn got a child in italy, this child is automatically considered italian, and so doesn't get added to the percentages above, because it is considered racist.","1. Slavery exists in a number of places today.\n2. The holding of slaves has been widespread across many peoples, beginning as far as we know with ancient Sumer (c. 5000 BC).\n3. It was endemic in Africa when the Portuguese arrived in the 1500s, and still exists there.\n4. The ancient Romans had slaves, and slavery existed throughout Europe until the 19th century.  The Dutch banned slave trading in 1792, and the English in 1803 (not to be confused with the continued holding of existing slaves).\n5. Islam still accepts slavery, and the Arabs were major slavers in Africa, as well as taking slaves from Europe in the Mediterranean.  The Barbary Wars, wherein the US Marines were first used (\"to the shores of Tripoli\"), were fought to end the Turkish enslavement of whites.\n6. China had all kinds of slaves from at least the 9th to the 19th centuries.\n7. Japan had and official slave system until 1590.  After that it occasionally used forms of slavery associated with prisoners of war, notably in WWII.\n8. Native Americans held war captives as slaves prior to the arrival of Europeans (and then sometimes copied them in holding African slaves).\n\nWhat stands out the US is that we had a vocal abolitionist movement from the late 1700s on (as Europe did); that we fought a civil war over slavery; that we killed a President over it; that ex-slaves are both racially distinct and a significant percentage of our large population;  that we became the leader of the free world--with a Declaration of Independence that reads like an ode to hypocrisy in that light-- while carrying that very visible baggage; and finally that harking back to slavery has become a useful political tool for blacks seeking to rise socioeconomically.  So we have become the whipping boy, so to speak.\n\nTo answer your question in a word, no.  Slavery was normal.

I think it might be because when I die I won't be thinking about the pain I cause because I don't know when I'll die, this is what is different from suicide. Suicide is to plan your own death. But death will just happen naturally whenever it's meant to. It may seem selfish that it ends up tying in with my own self guilt but knowing that I will one day die motivates me now.

Of course it's okay to accept that everyone dies, it's a pat of life, and if that spurs you on to live your life how you want and do all the things you want to do then that's fantastic. However, if you want to die then it's definitely in your best interest to talk to someone about your feelings (whether that be a friend, family member, counsellor or a helpline).  Death is natural and whilst it may be scary many people resort to their religion\/beliefs as comfort (heaven, reincarnation, no consciousness etc.) You can fight for you life and accept death as a natural thing, whilst it comes to us all some people would like to make the most of their lives and live as long as possible (if that made sense, sorry I'm half asleep right now haha)","You should live your life.

But it detracts from the actual problem.","For this exact issue I would say it has to do with the fact that the precautions people always reccomend are normally along the lines of \"don't drink too much, or don't wear a skirt that short\" which from the perspective of people who are being told that it would appear others are encroaching upon their freedom. Whereas telling someone to lock their door at night, or don't leave cash unattended is just encouraging common sense.","i dont blame the woman but there are many women that act helpless and get away with doing things to men.\nmy own step sister bought a hunting knife and told everyone it is because i scare her sometimes. everyone believes her because she is skinny and weights 100 pounds less than me, and since im the fat one, they support her using it.\n\nmeanwhile she has kicked my ass so many times since we were teenagers and *I* am afraid of her she has a temper and she strangled me many times.\ni have actually tried to hurt her in self defense and never came close because she moves so much faster. so it must be nice to have a bikini body that everyone obsesses over you and beating up the fat boy, but don't act like a victim.","[deleted]","I agree with what you're saying, and I think this might help see this from a new perspective. Obviously, we should not need to do any of this, but we do. I think a lot of the problem is, to what extent should we need to do this? Yes, there is always the potential for someone to try to shoot you in the street. Does that mean we should always be wearing body armor? Or should there simply be more deterrents for those shooting people in the street? It is always a good precaution to lock your house and your goods, but it's also an easy one. There's not a lot of super easy ways for anyone, man or woman, to protect themselves if they get attacked in any way. The best solution would be to solve the problem of the attacks happening. If you think about it, should we blame people for getting robbed if they didn't lock their house? Yeah, they didn't lock their house, but the ones robbing are still doing something illegal. The homeowners just have better faith in the security of things than they should have, but is that their fault? A better solution would be to solve the problem of people robbing houses. So if a woman gets attacked, I feel like, yes, there are definitely things she could have done to prevent this, but should she have to? Yes, we can lock up our personal items, but should we have to?","Well, let me put it to you this way... everyone locks up their house when they leave. At least everyone with any sense. But homes still get broken into. We don't tell people that it happens to 'you shouldn't have bought that fancy TV, or computer system because you're just asking to get robbed.' They were taking some precautions, but maybe they accidentally told the wrong co-worker about their vacation, or posted pictures from it before getting home without thinking. Or they just had bad luck and someone noticed there weren't enough lights\/activity, or they even got lucky and weren't home during something that would have turned violent.\n\nEveryone with any sense is careful about who they leave their kids with. But the vast majority of cases of sexual abuse towards minors are done by a family member or friend of the family. Someone trusted. We don't blame either the parents or children for putting their trust in someone they loved and who they thought was a decent person. They were deceived, and betrayed by someone with some hidden demons. Blaming them at a time like that is just adding insult to injury. Sometimes there are warning signs, but many times there aren't.\n\nFinally, one of the most common examples of victim blaming is focusing on what they were wearing, or where they were, and whether or not they had people with them. So put yourself in that position for a moment. You aren't allowed to wear certain things outside your home, no matter how much you like wearing them. Let's say in this case you're not allowed to wear suits. Many guys love wearing suits. But you can't wear suits outside, not because they're indecent or anything, you're not trying to walk around in a g-string, or a nazi uniform, but wearing it might get you attacked simply because other people can't control themselves. Even if you do dress in a modest, boring fashion, you can't go out at night or you might get attacked. You can't go anyplace that isn't highly public and visible, or you might get attacked. You can't go out on your own or you might get attacked, and even with people, in some areas of your town you'll still probably get attacked depending on whether or not your guards look sufficiently intimidating. \n\nAfter years, decades of this, every day, non-stop, no way to escape it, you're going to feel frustrated and trapped. Imprisoned in a way. Then if you finally do work up the nerve to try to be bold, and stand on your own, wear what makes you feel good about yourself, go where you want to go, even going by yourself to show the world that you aren't a child who needs someone to always hold their hand, and you -do- get attacked, you have people shaking their fingers at you saying 'you shouldn't have done that, should've just kept playing it safe,' you're probably going to be pissed off, and even more hurt. It doesn't matter if the advice is sensible, and obvious. It's probably something you already knew, you just thought maybe for once you could be a little independent. \n\nIn that kind of position, you aren't allowed to be you. You aren't allowed to explore. You aren't allowed to have even a modest adventure without careful planning and a bodyguard, or a weapon, or a small army of your friends, because someone might go full caveman on you, even in places that are normally considered safe by people of the other gender. You aren't allowed the same kind of self-discovery and independence that guys take for granted. Ever. Hell yeah some people are going to be bitter about that. I sure as fuck would be.","When bad things happen to people, many people tend to blame themselves, think they deserve it, and struggle with guilt - even when what happened to them is misfortune, bad luck, and\/or totally the fault of the other party.  \n\n\nFor this reason, I think many people feel it is better to be sensitive and avoid even slightly implying that it was that person's fault: especially with such a deeply hurtful and traumatic crime as rape (it's not like having your insured car stolen!).  \n\n\nI think it would be a tragedy for someone to get raped and blame themselves for it: for this reason it's best to tread carefully and avoid putting responsibility on the victim.  \n\n\nIn practice victim-blaming often refers to what the rape victim was wearing\/drinking:  I think it is important to strive for a society that respects and protects peoples freedoms, as soon as you start blaming a scantily clad rape-victim for the crime we might as well start handing out the burkas.","I think it\u2019s because some people clearly do not see where to separate the issue into practical application  and application of law. \nIf we view it from the law standpoint then telling the woman to either drink less or to cover her legs is actually very immoral since the purpose seems to be so that some man isn\u2019t provoked. I think it\u2019s wrong because regardless of what condition she is in, or regardless of her appearance it\u2019s the attacker who is legally wrong 100% each time. \n\nThe criminal law isn\u2019t there to measure the strength of desire of the man to determine how guilty he is but to judge his action.\n\nIn practical sense unrelated to law, I think it\u2019s also common sense to reduce the likelihood of an actual attack, so in some way, yes, it kind of does make sense for a woman to dress in a way that isn\u2019t interpreted like she is looking for a sex partner or which doesn\u2019t excite men too much. BUT there is a problem here too. Women cannot realistically be entirely responsible for what happens to them no matter how they dress, so understandably, some people will see that its unfair if women are told to wear less revealing clothes, or to drink less, just because some men cannot control themselves. Why shouldn\u2019t the perpetrators of the crime have been taught since the young age that someone\u2019s appearance isn\u2019t an invitation to be raped or an invitation to have sex.\n\nI\u2019d say that while it is a valid argument, if the purpose is still to avoid sexual assault, then it\u2019s more logical not to expect to change an entire society. This is particularly the case in some countries where society is backward and dysfunctional where men feel entitled to be able to approach and hit on any women they find attractive. \n\nMy opinion is that men and women should both control their behavior and if they want to avoid dangerous situations they should not simply hope they\u2019ll be able to control themselves when they are drunk but to trust their own drunk selves less and just not get too drunk. I think alcohol use through centuries has proven it. \n\nAs far as clothes I think that in history women who were even covered head to toe still became victims frequently, but that men were always given more excuses because of their male desires allegedly being more difficult to control, which is bullshit","Hey - lady here. I think you have a valid point, and some people take it too far...but it's a question of at what point do taking these precautions prevent women from living normal lives? At what point is it a catch-22?\n\nExample: I'm considering moving to a big city. I work in science, and sometimes I have to stay late in the lab to finish experiments. I'm trying to find an apartment in a safe area close to my workplace so that I can safely walk home at night. But I'm 5'4\" and 120 lbs., so this is going to involve some level of risk. So I've got a choice: do I put my career at risk by always trying to get out before sunset, do I put my health at risk by sometimes walking home in the dark, or do I put my finances at risk by always ordering Ubers I can't afford? You could argue that because my 6'3\", 225 lb. coworker doesn't have to deal with these tradeoffs, he's got a (slight) advantage over me that has nothing to do with whether or not we're good scientists, hard workers, etc. In that sense, I'm in an unfair situation that I did nothing to put myself into. No matter what I choose, I'm having to compromise on a reasonable demand (career, safety, finance).\n\nThere's a strain of feminism that believes all differences between the capabilities of men and women are inherently unjust (even those no one chose to create, such as differences in physical strength or the ability to become pregnant), and that society should be restructured to neutralize them. Therefore, these people would argue that I should not have to bear the cost of my inherent physical weakness relative to men. In a sense, I think they have a point. It is inherently unjust that if someone decides to commit a crime, I bear the consequences of that. (That holds for all crimes, of course, not just those against women.) These people would say I shouldn't put up with being mistreated in this way. Instead of trying to contort my life to keep myself safe from bad people, I should be able to have the confidence and self-respect to stand up for myself and demand fair treatment. \n\nThat said...in practice, I often agree with you. It's great to have the confidence and self-respect to stand up for yourself, but that's not going to stop you from being mugged by someone with 100 lbs on you. It's a similar dynamic to what can happen with sexual harassment in the workplace (again, I work in STEM--it happens.) You can complain all you want about how this is unfair, but in some environments, that's just going to get you harassed more. Is it right? No. But just like it's not fair for me to have to put up with being harassed, it's not fair for me to get punished for speaking up about it. I'm stuck. So sometimes, there's not really a good way out. You can be brave and fight the system. But you're going to bear the cost of doing so. If you want to survive in the workplace (or not be the victim of a crime), you're likely going to have to pick your battles.\n\nSo I think that's why suggesting self-protection measures are such a touchy topic. Though yes, it reduces your chance of being a victim of a crime, it can also impose other costs on your life that you don't deserve, and it may put you at a disadvantage relative to others. In psychologically intense situations (like domestic abuse or violent crime), someone might become so used to taking self-protection \"band-aid\" measures that they forget this isn't actually what they deserve, and they might compromise unnecessarily. \n\nOne more thing that I think is at play. Though I don't anyone would fault me for wanting to work late, a lot of behaviors that put women at risk of crime are controversial in broader society. Many people would say no one should be drinking to get drunk, or hooking up, or wearing revealing clothes, regardless of whether you can do it safely. Some of those people would then say, well, you get what you're asking for (in the sense that you are deliberately and unnecessarily putting yourself at risk by doing things you shouldn't be doing in any case.) Of course, that touches on sexual morality issues and adds a whole new level of emotional\/culture war intensity to the topic.","So, what I understand is that we all take precautions to protect our belongings.\nBut the problem lies when these things are either inanimate or are small children. Both these category do not have the ability to say a \"NO\", neither they have the ability to stop others. \nBut when it comes to a WOMAN, she knows how to say a NO. \nSexual harassment happens without consent, even after  a NO, even after multiple pushes and pulls to get out of the crime.\nAnd women cannot safeguard themselves by choosing the best covering clothes or going with a male relative for protection.\nAll we need is awareness and right education to all more that implanting the code of conduct for women alone.\nOf course women are protecting themselves, but still this happens again and again.\n\nSo, this is why if you say to the victim to be more cautious, it became contagious.\nShe was already pretty cautious and consicous. But the one who is the aggressor was ignorant of the fact that she is also a human, she has rights and his rights are restricted at her nose tip.","Women want to exert as much of their sexual power as possible with as few consequences as possible."],"77":[" I sense you are just a little quiet and get overlooked mainly because of that?

I think you hit most of the high points in the debate.\n\nI wish to bring up a slightly different take on the subject of 'mother's inconvenience'. Unless I missed it, you didn't bring up the child's quality of life. If a woman is poor in America, having a child is most likely going to make her poorer. No, I'm not suggesting that poverty alone is a justification for abortion, but I am suggesting that a child born in America will receive subpar healthcare, education, and job opportunities. I believe many anti abortion advocates lose interest as soon as the baby is born.\n\nAnother quality of life issue is handicapped children. I have a niece with Down's syndrome. She is a wonderful, happy person. She has endured open heart surgery, a tremendous variety of medications, and frequent er visits. Fortunately, the parents have good enough insurance. What about someone who doesn't? I have another friend who has a child who is essentially brain dead. His body never figured that out, so he is a 24 year old body with nobody living in it. Again, the parents have insurance. Should a parent who doesn't have to watch their child die shortly after birth? Or perhaps live a life of continuous privation because society isn't interested?\n\nI believe that until society is willing to take responsibility for the lives they want to control, abortion must be legal, safe, and free from harassment.","I\u2019ve come to stop having these discussions. It comes down to a fundamental disagreement as to when we define a life to begin.

And it\u2019s highly unlikely that someone will change their mind on the very crux of the matter.","Hi, I flagged this post for when I had time to respond to it, due to you seeming to cover the topic exhaustively but failing to mention the elephant in the room in any abortion debate:\n\nThe pro-life movement is about the subjugation of women.\n\nThe closest you came to this was stating that as a guy you still had say on the issue. That's fair enough, but we should keep in mind it's very easy to hold a hard line, extreme moral view when it's other people who have to make great sacrifices for that view while you stand to benefit from it. Compare with someone who has always preferred a vegan diet deciding one day to advocate outlawing meat. Sure you can make some moral arguments for that stand, but at the end of the day that person is asking everyone else to sacrifice a great deal for a cause that does nothing but benefit the vegan. The same is true of men demanding women make great sacrifices so they'll be more dependant on men. And the vegan's moral argument is better than the pro-lifers. The slaughter of a pig because it tastes good is less defendable than the death of a nearly brainless undeveloped organism for being a parasite. (I'm a man and a meat eater btw.)\n\nTo start, we need to acknowledge that the average pro-lifer claims to have a higher concern for the sanctity of life but clearly does not. Look at the type of politicians pro-lifers routinely vote into office: supporters of the Iraq War (100,000+ dead), supporters of the death penalty, opposers of gun control, opposers of pollution laws, of fighting global warming, of assisting access to health care, class action lawsuits, worker protections, etc.etc. Time and time again, pro-lifers vote for people who will put a tiny profit over human suffering on a routine and constant basis....then claim protecting life is their motive.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the two biggest groups opposed to abortions - Evangelicals and Catholics - are also notoriously sexist. Similarly all those who publicly claim abortion is murder but quietly fund their own daughter's abortion clearly never meant it.\n\nThe hypocrisy is so bad that many pro-lifers oppose teaching safe sex in schools or promoting easy access to contraceptions, even though these things are proven to reduce abortions. So they're willing to have others sacrifice their whole lives if that cuts down on abortions while they themselves can't even compromise slightly on single value. They're inconsistent on reducing abortions but very consistent on increasing unwanted pregnancies. \n\nLet's be clear: no access to abortions severely harms women. Unplanned pregnancies, especially at an early age, can all but destroy a person's career ambitions. Women are then forced to deprive themselves of perhaps the most pleasurible experiences one can have if they want a career. The empowerment of sexual freedom is diminished. Jealousy and resentment are increased towards women who don't choose career over sex by those who do. As the number of women who make it to the professional ranks diminish, these jobs are increasingly seen as \"men's jobs\" creating further barriers to success. And the woman who abstains until after her PhD? By the time she's ready to risk sex she's lost a decade of experience handling the emotional aspects of intimacy.\n\nThe result is a society where women are far more economically and emotionally dependant on men. This greatly benefits men as they no longer have to treat spouses well to maintain a relationship, and are more likely to even cheat or physically abuse while knowing their spouse can never leave. On top of that, there are more high level jobs available to men who otherwise would not be qualified for them.\n\nSo no, I don't believe for one second the abortion debate is about extreme compassion over all other factors for extreme concern for organisms with a barely developed reptilian brain. No it's about making women's lives shit so we men can treat them like shit.","MUH PATRIARCHY\n\njust ignore that many pro-lifers are women.

The entire reason that we aren't bring unified under one cause to end police brutality, is that people are too scared, too territorial, and too indifferent to join the movement. The fact is that police brutality affects us all, but it affects blacks the worst, and people are refusing to see that.

In recent years it lost its tabu.\n\nSo a 14yo in Italy knows pretty much what it means to have sex, to give consent or to say no.\n\nBut, in other parts of the world a 14yo doesn't because of the circumstances.","18 or legal adult based on both personal reasons. I suffered from child sexual assault and honestly, unless someone is a sicko there is no reason to engage in a relationship with a minor unless your of the same age group. Anyone not taking into account development of a minor's mental and physical health should face harsher punishment than a killer. Just my opinion. Its torture, pure and simple, that victims will face the rest of their lives. It takes a toll on their families and their future.","I think that it should be 18. In my opinion, the age for proper sexual consent really depends on the person. I was 15 when i started being sexually active and i was fully aware of what I was doing. That doesn't mean another 15 year old would be ready or prepared mentally to consent. I say 18 because at that age, it's almost impossible for someone to not be aware of what consent is.","I'm not going to say an age, but it should be based more on women's emotional development since they're in the more vulnerable position. \nSomehow define what specific factors play into the ability to effectively consent, study a large sample of people, calculate the average age at which the majority reach that stage of emotional development where they can check those boxes and I think that's as good as you'll get.\nIt will probably vary depending on what group the generalization is based on though.\n\nThere will always be cases where there are exceptions that don't fit the majority, but the law can't have too many grey areas, when rules need to apply to all.","For most people probably 16.

I read this example of misleading people with facts. Since you're a firefighter and it sort of fits this discussion you might appreciate it.\n\nIf you look at the statistics, you'll see that the more firefighters that go to a fire, the greater the economic damage. That is an accurate statement, a fact. I could imply from it that fact that loses form fire would drop if we sent out fewer firemen to each blaze. Fortunately most see the fallacy and would never accept the premise that if their house were on fire, 1 firefighter would be better than 10.\n\nI thank you for your dedication and a career of protecting others.","I would agree that certain measures are \u201cworking\u201d in the sense that one of the desired results is a lower than predicted death rate.  The problem with your argument, that I see, is that we are working with assumptive thinking at the front end, and attributing success to those assumptions without clear evidence yet.  I\u2019m not trying to say you\u2019re wrong, or that any of the experts are wrong, I\u2019m just saying that, for the most part, we have no evidence to show that any one, or a combination of government imposed safety measures is what has suppressed the the death rate.  Any hypothesis at this juncture is almost purely speculative.  The reports of data points showing correlation are wildly inconsistent and it\u2019s going to take years to sort it out.  Just for one example, attributing a death to the \u2018rona is financially incentivized.  Whenever a data point is incentivized you cannot automatically assume there are no gross errors in the reporting.  Due to the fact that the data is showing that \u2018rona deaths are overwhelmingly affecting those with serious comorbidities, including age itself, the data needs to be carefully scrutinized to adjust for this.  \n\nRight now we are observing the media and political figures run at the mouth with conclusions based on incomplete data.  The general public is intuitively aware of this, and doesn\u2019t quite know how to react.  The balancing act being performed by the various government levels looks more like contortionist reasoning.  As this is a \u201cnovel\u201d situation, this can be expected and forgiven, in large part.  The infringement on civil rights cannot.  No one should be arrested for violating a social distancing order.  No search and no seizures should be performed based on the same justification.  The transgressions against the 2nd Amendment are both patently absurd and highly unconstitutional, and can only be attributed to disingenuous left wing politicians taking advantage of a crisis to push a dangerous agenda.  \n\nI mention all these various social and individual rights conflicts to illustrate that there is an underlying, very fundamental problem that has bubbled to the surface of contemporary social issues.  There is a social battle occurring before us all that will determine how any national crisis gets used by those in the media and politics to push false narratives to achieve their pet agendas.  There are few in politics and their media allies that wish to limit state power, and this eats at the very foundation of the political theory our nation operates within.  The issues highlighted by this current \u201ccrisis\u201d are massive, the reaction is orders of magnitude in excess to the threat as reported current available data.  Americans aren\u2019t as stupid as other reactions to your post have stated.

You may have a few disagreeable men test your resolve, that's when you snap back with that tephlon personality.\n\nI may have made my point a winding road, but the gist of it is this: yes you are not what you may want to be. But go through life doing right and improving yourself. Everything else will happen as it should.","I think you should look at the match.com studies on why certain people get more matches than others. \n\nPolarizing looks tend to get more messages\/matches because they appeal and do well in a specific pool. \n\nOverall \u201cconventionally\u201d attractive people get less matches because it\u2019s not as polarizing.","Our value as human beings is not dependent upon our appearance. \n\nI remind myself of this daily.","The fact that you say the farther you get from the ideal is nonsense. You should ask the question, who chooses the ideal to look like how, from yourself. \nFrom the majority point of view, including myself, beauty is being in the best apparant condition. This does not include wearing fake eyelashes or wearing too heavy a makeup. It is the simple smell of perfume and the clothes of the person's desire.\nThose who seek big boobs and buttoks in women don't look for beauty, only the momentary pleasure. \nLastly, it's not ok to meet the criteria whose only effects are depression on teenagers and those who think lack physical attraction.","Beauty is subjective, dude.","You may be surprised to see how beauty standards have changed throughout history, and in different cultures. Its definitely worth a quick google. Personally, i think Beauty is subjective. I also think that perhaps we subject ourselves a lot of the time to beauty standards held by the society we live in.

Do they have their own friendships, hobbies, careers, and lives? Or will they be left emptyhanded and alone when their children grow up and move out? Can they even pass an evening at home with their spouse and no kids and not feel restless or ill at ease? \n\nAlso, is it even healthy for the kids? Or should they, past a certain age, be spending more time learning how to communicate and deal with social difficulties together, learning how to be independent and exist without mom or dad within arm's reach? Will they experience more severe separation anxiety when they need to go to school, since their parent(s) have been with them so often up until that time? Could that traveling game have been a small step towards greater comfort as an independent person for that kid, when instead it was More Time With Mommy And Daddy?\n\nIs it really healthy for *anyone* to have a family that seems to be joined at the hip?","> traveling sports game\n\nI'm confused by this. I was in marching band as a kid (90s). We were bused to and from the school if there were away games. We often got rides with other people to get home on Friday nights (or stayed over friends). Football kids did the same. Do parents go with their kids to these games, now??? The only parents who went regularly with our band were \"booster\" parents that volunteered their time to help out.

In every aspect of our laws and society on paper blacks have no disadvantage and even some advantages like scholarships. The problem is when you add people into the mix but there will always be racists just like there will always be anti vaxers and flat earthers idiots are always going to exist. I just don't see why the black community always has to be this separate entity from the rest of America. I understand that they have definitely had it the worst and racism is still a huge issue but say the Asian community who we still have oppressed in the past and threw into camps. When for example that Asian guy on American airlines who was beat. Nobody made it a point that the guy was Asian the point was made about how he was treated.

I'm going to go into full \"conspiracy\" mode but the dots line up. Here's a speech from Malcolm x \"The worst enemy that the Negro have is this white man that runs around here drooling at the mouth professing to love Negros and calling himself a liberal, and it is following these white liberals that has perpetuated problems that Negros have. If the Negro wasn't taken, tricked or deceived by the white liberal, then Negros would get together and solve our own problems. I only cite these things to show you that in America, the history of the white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make Negros think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems. Our problems will never be solved by the white man.\" He was able to acknowledge that his people need to solve their own problems and that political groups in the case liberals were just trying to be on their side to get their vote. My conclusion is the trickery worked, black people are constantly told by the media that they are being oppressed and the system is against you and everyone is racist and that they can never make it because how stacked the odds are, even if the cases are actually miniscule in comparison to the whole country. If some random store owner does something racist it immediately gets exploded to the front pages of the news. Black kids growing up are constantly told by their parents that white people will judge you for your color and hate you and police want to kill you so when something happens to them it will immediately click in their brain \"this is the racism I've been told about\". It's constantly spread around that white people are being raised to hate when that simply isn't the case. In school you are constantly told how racism is bad and it's put into your head that racism is the worst thing in the world (it is bad don't get me wrong). You're told this to the point of thinking even bringing up facts or statistics is racist. You're told to just acknowledge your privilege and that they would know about it much more than you and don't ask questions because that's racist. Even colleges have been forced to have mandatory social justice based classes that are based around opinion and not fact  I've had completely normal friends get sent to those and they came out left extremists. Every single Republican leader has been called racist and anything they ever do positive for the black community isn't reported. I don't know a single black Republican and I think this is why. I'm not even right wing I'm somewhere in the middle but if there has ever been something Trump has been 100% right about is how fake and biased mainstream media is. It seems kind of ridiculous that people haven't seen the hypocrisy in all of this getting mad at the right for not being as angry about this as they are and saying they're racist because of it when in reality it's because they see black people as equals not some race that needs to be protected. In conclusion I think black people are constantly put down so they won't have the will to try to improve their own situation and solve the problems that only they can solve in their community so that the left can be their \"champion\" to save them."],["I'd just love peace too this all seems so unnecessary."],["It\u2019s considered racist because it is racist.

Kaitlin Bennet, a white girl can walk around armed and unharmed but Tamir Rice, a black child was shot dead by police officers for holding a toy gun.

Yes men create systems to benefit men by getting men to do all the dangerous and hard things (93% of work deaths, and here the milatry)\n3. Many countries need conscription as voluntary private armies are too expensive for the nation. So it is needed. Of course the feminists know this and only want men to do it.

In a society where there is an increasing movement to 'normalise' being LGBT and have people being more accepting of it; then is celebrating people who 'come out' a way to normalise it? To celebrate someone 'coming out' or calling them 'brave' is to make it sound like they've made a big achievement and overcome something dangerous and not that they've done something people consider 'normal'. You don't celebrate someone calling themselves heterosexual or starting a family because these things are considered 'normal.' Several years ago I can understand this happening because people were not as accepting but today, although there are still people who disagree with people being LGBT a majority of people have no issue with it. I understand that it's partly about accepting people and making people feel more comfortable to come out but sometimes 'the noise of celebrating it' is what attracts the criticism. In the case of Phillip Schofield, I don't think it surprised many people that he's gay.","9":"Is it weird?

Since Corona is a big part of the world and it came from China it has been tons of videos where Asian people in other countries are getting harassed with violence and this is all from Asian pages I follow and see little to no from mainstream sources. Just think it's unfair and think we deserve some recognition like for example the black community.","15":"i think it\u2019s really important for people to know how important self care is. i feel like most of the time people are way too judged and blamed when they can\u2019t make relationships work, and a lot of the times this has to do with the trauma that their partners left, it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to make things work out, it\u2019s just that they really can\u2019t, or they aren\u2019t ready, that\u2019s why i\u2019ve always been saying it\u2019s better to be at peace with yourself first and then start to look for someone else, you can\u2019t make things work with others if you can\u2019t even make it work with yourself. always focus on healing yourself instead of focusing on looking out for others. learn to love yourself. learn to get some time alone with yourself. spend some time alone with yourself and be okay with you and you only, cause at the end of the day you only have yourself but nobody else. self care is so important and underrated.","16":"Does anyone else thinks its crazy how easy it is to fake having conversations with people?\n\nFor example I wanted to show how easy it would be to make James Charles seem like a predator.

All I need was a cropping app, a screenshot of James' instagram name and photo, and 2 instagram accounts and i made a fake conversation.\n\nHow is this technology so easily accessible when if it gets it the wrong hands it could be so damaging.","17":"Serious question people.

I was going to college about 6 hours away from my hometown, and trying to maintain a long distance relationship with a girl I had only known a couple months at the time I started my freshman year. Things went extremely well the first year, but when I was home between years 1 and 2, I got her pregnant. This, however, is not the regret.\n\nMy daughter was born during finals week of my sophomore year, and I wasn\u2019t able to make it home for her birth. That summer was stressful but enjoyable. We had support from both sides of the family and plenty of love to go around. And then I went back to school.\n\nThis was before the height of Skype or social media (late 90\u2019s), so the most I could do to stay fully involved was call home every day and make the trip back and forth each weekend. Obviously, cracks began forming here. My mind was at home with my daughter and her mother, and my grades began to severely suffer. I wasn\u2019t putting in the time or effort in my classes to succeed, and something had to give. Here\u2019s the decision that altered the course of the rest of my life: I decided to transfer to a school closer to home, and live full time with my girlfriend and daughter.\n\nWorst. Choice. Ever.\n\nThe responsibility of being a full time father, full time worker and full time student destroyed me. I spread myself so thin that I failed in every aspect. Girlfriend cheated, grades were terrible and I barely made enough money to eat (beyond paying all our bills). Ended up getting heavy into opiates, bombing out of school altogether and going months at a time not seeing or speaking to my daughter. \n\nIt has taken me nearly TWENTY YEARS to reassemble a decent life and a healthy relationship with my now-adult daughter. Finally kicked the drugs, but I\u2019ve never finished school and I\u2019m $70,000 in debt for student loans. At least I\u2019m creeping in the right direction now, but I\u2019ll always regret leaving school the first time.

In the 1840\u2019s anti-Irish sentiment boiled over into full scale anti-Irish riots in Kensington and SouthWark. The Irish brought the first wave of mass immigration of a single culture into the United States, thousands among millions arriving on the docks of the Delaware in the city of brotherly love. Fearing the economic competition brought by the arriving Irish, political groups across the country quickly demonized them through the use of media.  Labeled as drunken, lazy and *different*, the Irish struggled to find steady paying work, and were exploited by business owners looking for the cheapest form of labor outside of slavery, paying them a third of what non-Irish workers would be compensated. The Irish slowly found their footing in the expanding city because the Catholic Church was beginning to form a tight-knit community, laying the earliest groundwork for the Irish community of neighborhoods, churches and school systems that exist today. Kensington, Port Richmond, Fishtown and the rest of Northeast Philadelphia is a direct descendant of the earliest Irish communities in the city. In  May of 1844, a self -identified  political group the \u201cNativists\u201d, who saw themselves as *native Americans*, sparked a deadly three day riot in which Irish men, women and children were attacked, their homes, businesses and churches burnt to the ground. Several weeks later in July, a second deadly wave of the *Nativists Riots* erupted yet again, this time spurring a military response to quell the devastating violence. \n\nThe Nativist, spurred by propaganda touted in media outlets, saw the Irish as a threat to not only their economic success, but their inherit rights as an *American.* The Irish saw the Nativist as ruthless and cruel, the Irish sought refuge in the United States as the catastrophic potato blight took its toll in their homeland. Millions of Irish farmers, subservient to the British Crown and their Landlords, were left to starve after their essential potato crop failed. Meanwhile, Irish farmers shipped surpluses of other crops out of the country, satisfying rising demands for the British crown. They were forgotten and left to die. Arriving in a new nation, touted as being opportunity personified, brought them criticism and xenophobia to these poor people. \n\nThe Irish were on the lowest rung of Philadelphian society, even lower than the few free black citizens residing in the city. In 1842, the Irish sparked their own riot targeting these black citizens in the streets of Philadelphia. As a group of parading black citizens celebrated  the anniversary of the end of slavery in the West Indies, Irish men confronted the crowd outside of St. Bethels church on Lombard Street. The ensuing riot saw the beating of innocent black citizens, and the destruction and looting of black homes and churches. \n\nThe Irish contempt for blacks mirrored the nativists contempt for the Irish. The Irish saw the black population as competition for the already little work they could access. The whispers of abolition movements sent fear through the Immigrant communities that soon 4.5 million enslaved blacks would scatter across northern cities, business owners paying them *even less* than what they would pay the Irish, ,in which case, *why employ the Irish?*\n\nToday, the George Floyd Riots unfortunately prove the notion that history repeats itself. The descendents of Immigrant communities residing in Philadelphia's Northeast region comprise the new menial labor force. Instead of stepping off the dock after fleeing famine, and being paid less than pennies to dig ditches, this generation of  Northeast Philadelphians are pushed through schooling and left to compete in a horrible job market, many of them only able to access minimum wage or service positions. Even well paying jobs aren't *well paying*, and as the Coronavirus  pandemic and response shows, very insecure. Instead of being victims of hunger, they are victims of the outsourcing of jobs in the 1970\u2019s, defunding of education, and the cycles of poverty that have always existed within these neighborhoods. They are victims of being a good life lies within material goods, produced in foreign countries by people comparable to their immigrant ancestors. However, the main difference between this generation and the Irish immigrants is that the Irish immigrants understood that their life in the city was horrible, and that their enemies were spurred by business owners using  xenophobic media  representations. Today, this generation of Northeast Philadelphians are patriotic. Convinced that the United States fits the criteria of all our freedom filled phrases, they view their middle class lives as successful. They are able to praise the military and ignore its use; the Kissenger report, Gulf of Tonkin and the false promise of Nukes in Iran  are cast aside by their love for the flag coming from *Saving Private Ryan* and the national anthem before professional sports. Surely we, the heroes of WWII, would never use our military for corruption, profit and disgusting greed. Hardworking , uneducated and miserable, Northeast Philadelphians ignore the studies of land pollution and cancer pockets, and daydream about the yearly Zac Brown concert and the chance of an all inclusive resort or cruise for one week a year. Meanwhile, they see black people as the Nativists saw their ancestors. Intoxicated, lazy, and *different*. Ignoring the historical and basic explanations of how and why black communities came to be, they go about their life unaware of the impact that generations of poverty have had on black people. Despite the Civil Rights Movement ending only a short 50 years ago, they expect uneducated, discriminated, poverty ridden black communities in the city to fit their idea of *decency.* It is impossible for them to relate to their struggle, because they think their struggle is more American. They believe in stereotypes and fear black crime. While there is black crime, it has less to do with skin color and more to do with decades of poverty, policy and policing ensuring those policies.  Slightly less racist than their parents, who are slightly less racist than *their parents*, Northeast Philadelphians take to social media condemning any form of protest, peaceful or non-violent. Colin Kapernick was immediately attached to the idea of dishonoring the military, ignoring decades of the United States sending their sons off to die for the profit of the 1%. Instead of their anger being directed upward, they squabble and compare themselves to West and North Philadelphians. *Well, would you walk around there at 3am? Lets see if you think blue lives matter then.*  They have vague understandings of culture, history and their relation to business owners. In old England,  Small numbers of aristocrats with upturned noses in posh London apartments despised the dirty criminals living in city slums. Now, low-middle class white people in row homes with tv stands with their kids prom photos on them watch the news and judge the impoverished communities in the city. *Look at these animals*, they\u2019ll say. *Of course, they would kill another officer, they are animals.* Or *I'm so proud of my nephew. He graduated from Father Judge and joined the \\_*(police force, national guard, military*,* all of them low paying, all of them operating for greed, and successfully do so by promoting xenophobia)  They road rage through the city, drinking bad coffee and eating unhealthy food, muttering under their breaths at the mere sight of a  black person that fits their idea of *thug,* or a white person thats a *junkie.*  They stand arm in arm defending large scale businesses in their neighborhoods, billion dollar corporations employing thousands of Philadelphians coming from the interconnected  histories of poverty and economic competition,  barely paying them above minimum wage. They accept the current status-quo of labor. *Work A-lot for very little.* The problem is, they don't see what they have as little. Popular culture is the most popular in these middle class communities. Worship the celebrity, find joy in mass marketed musicians, find cable television awe inspiring.\n\nDo they not know rioting once gave Americans the chance for a \u201cdecent\u201d wage? They are not taught how and why modern notions of racism are touted by people looking to make *money*. What was the purpose of slavery? The answer is the search of the best possible form of labor*:free*.  What is the best way to get people to support slavery? Make you fear the slave. What was the point of paying Irish immigrants next to nothing wages? The answer is that it was the next best thing to slavery. What is the purpose of defunding inter-city schools? Prep the graduates for minimum wage instead of college .What is the purpose of convincing Northeast Philadelphians to be racist? It ensures they see what little they have as far better than what *they* have. They work hard for so little, and hate those that have even less. Look at their despise for safe injection sites. *Why help the lazy no good Junkie, I work everyday why not help me ? Why help the lazy no good blacks, I work everyday why not help me?* \n\nThey are not bad people. They work hard and love their families. However, They are making the same mistake their ancestors made nearly 200 years ago. Instead of struggling together, they use the black community as a scapegoat. What was once the scapegoats\u2019 scapegoat in Philadelphia during the influx of Irish Immigrants, the black community is their biggest enemy (so they are told). To them, they represent the enemy of what they find most sacred, *America*. They see the civil rights movement as just another moment in history,  limited to museums and BET. They hear rap and think *Music to rile up the animals*. They have successfully been convinced that they are different from the minority by those who profit off of division. Instead of condemning the 1% for wealth hoarding, they condemn minority voices crying for human rights. Instead of unity of struggling together against those exploiting them both, they struggle against one another.","36":"SPOILER WARNING as the comments on this posting will surely contain information that can ruin the movie  for those who haven't seen it yet. \n\n* * * * * * \n\n* * * \n\n* \n\nThis movie has become one of my absolute favorite movies of the last 5 years.\n\nFor me, I think it comes down to the fact that it was a great comedy, using subject matter that could be considered very sensitive to some people, especially the subject of Hitler himself, and yet sucker punches you in the gut a few times with certain events that happened during the movie which I won't spoil here specifically.\n\nI'm curious how others felt about the movie?","37":"I\u2019m a junior in high school, and I just don\u2019t like hanging out with my friends anymore.

Polite discussion I feel like is being replaced by screaming what you think is right and ignoring, and attacking anyone who disagrees, or agrees, but has a  slightly differing opinion. If you don't echo the same thing verbatim you're attacked. I'm not the most intelligent person, not by a LONG shot, im an average joe.

So recently I started noticing how a bunch of platforms are getting worse and stricter, because we are not allowed to say anything that someone might find offensive. I like dark humour and I find it hilarious when some people get offended when it was clearly a joke. Of course sometimes it can be actual racism, homophobia etc. For example youtube. There are bunch of youtubers who cannot support themselves because someone got offended and reported them. We live at a time where a single person can ruin people carries just because they didn't like it or got offended. If anybody has watched ,,Hazbin hotel'' you would know that the cartoon takes place in hell (a place that bad people go), but a lot of people said thta the show was offensive and that chareacters were homophobic and racist even tho that the whole point as the show takes place in hell. Then there's Twitch who announced they would have a team who would help them set the rules and other stuff. FerociouslySteph is one of them. He's a transgender who identifies as a male deer. Yes a deer. Now I don't fgive a f--k about that. The thing is he is dellusional and one of those snowflakes. He or she (I don't know) thinks that game voicechats are bad and should be removed because they can be racist. The thing is mute buttons exist. He also thinks all gamers are white supremacist. This person has power in Twitch now. Streamers are afraid to say anything because there's a high chance they will get banned. The point is these dellusional, self-absorbed special snowflakes are controlling the internet and ruining it. I really want to know what other people think about this. So please share your ideas  and have nicew day <3","68":"I\u2019m an engineering contractor 25yrs old and have been running a contract on a customer site for 2 years. I have trained up a few guys to be my number two who moved on to better jobs. \n\n6 months ago a guy who\u2019s in his 50\u2019s came to work with me as a lube tech. (He carries a grease gun all day and greases machines). I told him on his first day that I know it\u2019s weird me being half your age and there may be somethings you\u2019re not happy about with how I run things and please make them known as I want you to enjoy your time here. \n\nHe was very amicable and friendly and we actually became good friends (I\u2019m a blacksmith in my spare time and made him a chef knife to say thanks for being such a good teammate etc). \nAround when he started I was having a hard time at work, the customer turned very nasty and were throwing out lots of accusations of me not knowing how to do my job and that I wasn\u2019t performing properly. I then had to provide evidence to the contrary which was stressful working your ass off and then being told you\u2019re shit. \nAt Christmas time we have our reviews and my manager tells me I have to squash any issues I have with the lube tech and just get on with the job. I\u2019m confused by this as I thought we were great friends. Thought the boss had the wrong end of the stick and thought nothing more of it. \n\nEarlier this week I had another colleague on site who warned me about the lube tech, said he talks behind my back and complains about me constantly, I then contacted the boss who did the review to ask him if this is why it came up in my Christmas review. \n\nThe boss then tells me he thought I knew and was just being professional about the whole thing and says he\u2019s got a complaint folder of over 200 emails from the lube tech stating I don\u2019t know how to do my job, I turn up late and go home early, I spend my days on my laptop watching films and that I wasn\u2019t suitable to be site lead. \n\nTurns out my boss investigated these claims and came up empty found me doing a good job and left it at that. So the lube tech bypassed him and then made complaints to his manager about me and my manager trying to get us both fired and then even contacted the company group director about me saying he didn\u2019t feel safe working for me. \n\nI wasn\u2019t aware of any of this until a few days ago and now my head is fucked, I thought we were great friends even out of work, I think he might be a bit of a sociopath considering I never had even the slightest idea that he was doing this or acting like this. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t know that I know. \n\nWhat do you think I should do? I\u2019m planning on moving jobs as soon as corona lockdowns lift.","69":"If you feel like you disagree with someones opinion I completely understand. Lets start off strong. Most people have there dislikes it could be racial, sexual interest, or just something plain stupid. \n\nI believe everyone is allowed to be what they want and do what they want. I also believe everyone should be allowed an opinion, and even if I disagree with it at the end of the day I shouldn\u2019t try to change their opinion.\n\nFor instance some people are homophobic, they aren\u2019t scared of lgbt, but just have a general disliking towards them. This isn\u2019t always the case though. We have other good people who do support lgbt which is good we have a day each year for it and it makes the community feel good. Now most people usually don\u2019t admit to being homophobic because its seen as rude or offensive. If its unsaid, and the person doesn\u2019t like it its not considered bad in my opinion. I think if it gets to far and someone starts breaking things or breaking laws to prove a point that is dumb, and you shouldn\u2019t do that. At that point it becomes invalid whatever you are trying to prove, because it invalidates your opinion and your view is down the drain. If you are just going to be negative with your claim saying f this or this is nasty without any actual evidence to why the thing you are trying to prove is bad then just keep it to yourself. Otherwise people will disagree with you and attempt to change your opinion. \n\nMy viewpoint is that most people can\u2019t change in general I see constantly everywhere just negative opinions on certain subjects, and I just don\u2019t feel like discussing why it could be a good thing or a bad thing. If you really want to change someones view you need evidence, hard facts, you can\u2019t be rude or dismissive. You have to state your point without it coming across as I\u2019m forcing you to change your opinion or view. \n\nMy friend once told me people can change. I know they can, but will they actually change rather than just ignoring your reasoning and being ignorant towards your view saying you\u2019re wrong. You can\u2019t be this way towards this subject. \n\nTo end this I want to say that if you feel negativly towards a certain subject, opinion, or just a basic view. Know who you\u2019re dealing with and be open minded while discussing your reasoning with them. You don\u2019t want them to get mad over something you said that they disagree with, but to have a mutual opinion or just to leave it as you can\u2019t really agree on it. Not because they\u2019re ignorant, but because your view is vastly different than theirs.","70":"First off, this is not an attempt at veiled racism.

The generic response being that women should be able to go about their lives without fear of attack from men. Now whilst I completely accept this should be the case, sadly it\u2019s not. People will always do bad things and we take precautions to prevent those. \n\nWe lock our houses and cars to prevent burglaries and thefts when ideally people shouldn\u2019t steal. \nWe don\u2019t let our children off with unknown strangers in case they harm the child when people just shouldn\u2019t hurt kids. \nYou don\u2019t walk around showing all your cash in case somebody steals it. \nYou don\u2019t go to bad neighbourhoods in case you\u2019re attacked. \nWe have passwords for our personal information and internet banking to prevent fraud. \n\nIf we got robbed because we left our house unlocked when we weren\u2019t there or your child was hurt because you let them go off with a complete stranger, in general society would look upon you as being an idiot for not taking basic precautionary steps to prevent those because everyone knows you should be careful. (To clarify I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s idiotic when women don\u2019t do things to protect themselves). \n\nSo if it\u2019s normal societal behaviour to expect people to take reasonable steps to protect themselves, why do some people not apply this to protecting women from harm? The only reason that comes to mind is because the \u2018fault\u2019 is (usually) only being attributed to women whereas my other examples could be applied to both men and women. Even to myself, my reason doesn\u2019t seem like a good one but I honestly fail to see another viable reason to it so I\u2019m hoping people can help me get a better one.","77":"My school\u2019s robotics team is all boys plus me. I feel bad about being a girl, the only girl, because I would get a hotel room all to myself since they are boys and students can room with teachers, even though my teacher is the same gender as me. I feel bad because I cost them $400 dollars, and if it were me and another girl then it\u2019d be $200 dollars because the hotel does that for some reason. In the robotics team, I\u2019m not seen as a girl at all by my teammates, and honestly that makes me so happy and thankful for them. I\u2019m just one of them, you know? However, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m not being taken seriously when I remind them to wear their safety glasses, or if I tell them to stop playing with something because it could hurt someone if it flew out their hand. I do that because my team voted me safety captain this year. There are a few who do take me seriously (I\u2019m only using first names), like Randall, our co-captain Noah, Gabe takes me seriously but you just have to be very direct about it, which is fine for me because I did that too when I was little. Tristan ... is Tristan because he treats everyone the same. The other two, they don\u2019t really take me seriously. For Dylan I have to curse him out to get him to realize that I\u2019m serious, and Colin doesn\u2019t really listen until someone else tells him to do it. Also when discussing meetings, goals, whose doing what, I get left out in the coding side of the conversation, kind of like I\u2019m not there. Then Gabe, he\u2019s so sweet once you meet him, brings up my name to Mrs.Gil, the teacher, that I\u2019m also a coder, and she\u2019s like \u201cOh! Right! Charlotte you can handle blah blah blah , right?\u201d Sometimes I feel like I bring nothing to the table, that I\u2019m just the girl who knows how to code in python but is now learning Java, I\u2019m almost done with it, and just there to replace our senior coder Tristan. And it\u2019s hard for me to deal with this because I know I bring things on the table, and that I have already contributed some ideas and solutions for different things. I\u2019m even called \u201cthe master\u201d of building gear boxes because I can do it quickly, with all the parts of course. I know it\u2019s probably not because I\u2019m a girl, because when there was a sexist guy on the team, we\u2019ll call him Bob, said something sexist me, everyone else just kinda paused and looked at him weird,(for context, I\u2019ve never been directly insulted by any sexist comments, none that I can think of anyway, and I\u2019m also older and up a grade from him.) and I froze in my spot, because I was thinking he was talking to the teacher. That\u2019s when the two co-captains that lead our team kicked him right out the club. I didn\u2019t realize what actually happened until they came back and I just was confused. Was he really talking to me? I\u2019m not... I\u2019m not stupid am I? How did I not realize until after the fact? And I couldn\u2019t even defend myself because I was in too much of a shock to react. My team all looked at me after our captains came back and just started talking about him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him Charlotte! Obviously the guy has a smaller brain than a chicken.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the one of the funniest people I know.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re so non-judgmental and accepting!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re one of the only people that I can actually have a conversation with and them not getting offended by it!\u201d And I wanted to cry. The other day they were talking about a character in a show on YouTube (Hazbin Hotel) and comparing me to the main character, Charlie, because we have the same name. Noah goes ,\u201dShe\u2019s gay-\u201c Colin jumps in \u201cJust like our Charlotte!\u201d And we all laughed. And it was good. It felt good to not be seen as my gender, but to be seen as my name. That\u2019s the whole reason that I\u2019d honestly say that the robotics club is actually a better team to be in than our band program, I play the flute, because it\u2019s just people who want to build a robot, and people who want to code said robot. So I know that I shouldn\u2019t be feeling like they\u2019re not taking me seriously because I\u2019m a girl, and they aren\u2019t adding me into serious conversations about plans and stuff because I\u2019m a girl. But why do I feel left out? Am I really just a girl to them sometimes? Just \u201cOh right, and Charlotte\u2019s here...\u201d How do I bring it up to them? If I do will they look at me as more of a girl than they do now?? What should I do? I don\u2019t want to lose my place as being \u201cone of the guys\u201d you know? But I don\u2019t want to be left out on somethings like important discussions or making goals for the week. I don\u2019t want to be the \u201coh right\u201d in the discussions. I don\u2019t want to be an after thought. How do I fix this?","78":"I am not anorexic in the sense that I want to LOOK skinny.

I am not \"pro-choice\", nor am I \"pro-life\". I find the labels themselves to be the first volley of a deliberate attempt to create euphemisms to hide the fact of what the discussion is actually about.   \n\n\nSo that being said, I want to create a real place of debate and thoughtful discussion. I'd like to discourage sloganeering and twitter-style argumentation. This topic is COMPLEX, and I don't think it can be summed up in \"X is true, so deal with it\".   \n\n\nI'm doing this not to grandstand my own beliefs. I'm doing this because I'm generally trying to understand both sides to this issue, and to better formulate my own beliefs. If I'm mistaken in anything I write below then please let me know and we can have a civil discussion about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to generalize a bit here for brevity. I know that there probably aren't really \"two sides\" to this issue (even though it's being portrayed as such, I believe, to deliberately drive a wedge between two different political sides, but that's a discussion for another day). I believe most people can find places of compromise and agreement although radical positions exist on either side. I'm merely trying to posit common arguments as I've encountered them and my thoughts on them to save time and effort.   \n\n\nSo here we go: \n\nThe most common pro-abortion position I've heard is that a fetus is not a human being and should not be afforded the same protections as such. A correlative argument to this one is that even if it is, a woman has a autonomy over her own body and that should trump any standing the fetus has as a human being.   \n\n\nSome radical pro-choicers will go so far as to say infanticide actually is morally justifiable. I'm not making this up. This is becoming a more common position it seems ([https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2012\/03\/after-birth-abortion-the-pro-choice-case-for-infanticide.html](https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2012\/03\/after-birth-abortion-the-pro-choice-case-for-infanticide.html)). This position terrifies me. I find it misanthropic and can lead to an ethical black hole which could ultimately justify genocide. If you believe that an obvious murder like this is ethical or ought be legal, then I ask you to respectfully leave this thread alone. That is a far deeper hole than I'd like to go down in this discussion. For the sake of argument, I want to start with the presupposition that the taking of a human life is a morally wrong thing and ought to be proscribed. If you have an argument that killing people is sometimes necessary or allowable ethically in some circumstances to answer the abortion question, then fine, make that argument. But if you can't accept the axiom that murdering full grown babies out of the womb is indefensible, then let's take that discussion to another forum.  I **really, really hope** that the vast majority of you don't agree with this noxious notion for the sake of all of humanity. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are also those rabid enough  who would contend that I ought not have any stake in this issue at all and that I have no business discussing it because of my sex. I find this insulting. I have not revealed my sex (I'm a guy, if you're curious), but if you think that men don't have a place at the table if the question is \"should we be murdering people\"- especially if it's THEIR child that may be on the chopping block, then you're a bigot. Full stop. You are a sexist and I don't want to hear from you.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo above I listed two arguments that I feel are at the crux of the pro-choice position. There are other arguments such as \"what about all the unwanted children\" and such. These don't seem applicable unless we can address those two. If we can't answer what is a human life and when is it ethical to take another human life, then those types of questions are moot. A satisfactory to the question of \"What do we do with all these unwanted children\" is not going to be \"Murder them all\"- that would be tantamount to the pro-infanticide position I mentioned above. Murder is generally not accepted to be a moral way to solve practical problems. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA far better argument would be to address the first two propositions- that abortion isn't the killing of human life so no problem, or that it is but it's justifiable somehow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe pro-life argument is often couched in religious terms, but not always. Many pro-lifers come to their conclusions because of their religious doctrine that states that human beings have souls in a very real metaphysical sense, or that God would frown upon such a practice. While I respect these religious arguments, I don't believe they have a place in discussions of public policy. As we live in a society which has guaranteed a free expression of religion, then legally religion can't inform pubic policy as not everyone is going to share the same religious views. Arguing this position from a religious standpoint is therefore a non-starter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut not all pro-life arguments stem from religious belief, contrary to what is being parroted by pro-choice advocates. Many pro-lifers argue from a moral philosophy kind of standpoint, and can make reasoned arguments for their position. This position would be that a human fetus is a human life, and that ending that life (and most people would say, barring certain circumstances), would be akin to murder and should therefore held accountable as such. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you feel the arguments above aren't relevant, or aren't an accurate description of your views then please let me know.   \n\n\nHere's my take:   \n\n\nAgain, we're going to start with the axiomatic assumption that murder is wrong and ought be criminalized. Again, if you disagree with this then let's go somewhere else to talk about THAT basket of worms. But if you agree with this sentiment (and I really, really hope you do), then we have to define murder. In most law, it is the intentional killing of one person by another. Manslaughter would be its cousin- the non-intentional killing of another person, perhaps by negligence. \n\nAnd so, in the legal tradition, we have to also define what \"person\" means. Legally it is defined as : 1) a human being. 2) a corporation treated as having the rights and obligations of a person \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOW we get into the sticky part. Murder is the intentional killing of a human being. What do we mean by human being? This is the philosophical conundrum we are faced with abortion. Do you see now how this rapidly becomes a deep and complex issue that can be debated with slogans and tweets? We are dealing with the question of the fundamental nature of humanity. This ain't a picnic. This isn't easily solved. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo let's start with human being. Again, we are going to go with the (hopefully) general agreement that a human infant is in fact a human being. I think the easiest way to answer the \"is a fetus a human being\" question is to extrapolate backwards. If an infant is a human being, is it a human being a few minutes earlier when it is in the birth canal or the uterus? If you don't think so, then I'd really like to hear your reasons why. Physiologically it is no different. It possesses the same brain and amount of consciousness it does after birth. It possesses a heartbeat. (Personally I'm philosophically bent towards the idea of consciousness and sentience being at the core of what makes a human a human, but I'm open to other interpretations). It would take a great deal of convincing to explain how an infant that is surrounded by tissue is somehow a different entity to one that is not. Good luck. You can try, but I think that's a large hurdle to jump over.\"Well it hasn't breathed!\" OK- some infants don't take their first breath until a minute or so after delivery into the world- a generally scary moment when the doctor has to maybe remove the umbilical cord that's wrapped around their neck or something like that. Let's also mention the unfortunate implications this has for people who are on life support who cannot breathe on their own. I don't think an argument that defines human beings as \"something that breathes\" is convincing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if we were being honest about the abortion issue, then we can basically extrapolate further back in time and try to some agreement as to when a fetus \"becomes\" a human.  This is tricky, but I think many, many people can extrapolate back to the zygotic stage and say \"oh, well, there's no brain, no heartbeat. I can't find a reason that terminating this is wrong as it lacks what I think makes a human a human\". I think there's more people who can find common ground there than people think. If we take this a bit further, then fewer people will be onboard, but we can still reach some kind of consensus. Personally I'd draw that line at neurological development and the formation of the brain. This is tricky as neurons start to cobble together relatively early, and the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain develop in week 3, with them starting to function at week 4. By the end of the first trimester all major organs are intact. I think it's safe to say that post-first trimester abortions are about where most people opposed to abortion would start to think this is becoming problematic from a moral standpoint. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo maybe that's a good point to draw the line. At least I think so. That's my tenuous position as of now. It's a conservative position (in terms of degree, not in terms of politics) , to be sure, but if the quandary that we're discussing is that we're potentially murdering millions of people in the womb, then I'd err on the side of caution. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUT- that's not the end of the discussion right? Because we have pro-choice argument two to contend with. A pro-abortion person may say \"OK, we'll concede that it's difficult to argue that a fetus isn't a human life after the first trimester, but that argument is irrelevant because a woman has autonomy over her body. She shouldn't be obliged to support it as it is a part of her as well.\"    (again, this argument only has weight if we already accept that the fetus is in fact a human life. If we do not, then this argument is unnecessary, as the moral justification for killing the fetus would not have the same moral consequence as killing a person)   \n\n\nThis is a good argument. It's one that also requires a deep dive into ethics and is an attempt to answer the question \"When is the taking of a life of another morally permissible?\" Most could agree that self-defense is a good reason to kill another. If someone shoots another that is threatening their life or limb, then that would be morally justified in most people's view. I also hold this view, and although a fetus isn't intentionally trying to harm the mother, there are cases in which its presence may severely threaten the health of the mother. An ectopic pregnancy is one of those times. There may be other, more rare circumstances in which the fetus is threatening the mother at a later stage in development. I see no moral issue in terminating the fetus if that's the only means of saving the mother's life (or preventing debilitating injury or illness). This would be unfortunate and sad, but morally justifiable, in my view. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSO with that out of the way let's address autonomy. A woman has autonomy over her body, as does a man. This is a major point in western society- an enlightenment idea, as JS Mill put it: \" Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\" It is an incredibly important value that I believe should not be discounted lightly.   \n\n\nBut this must also be the case for the fetus if it is a living human being. The fetus ALSO has agency and individual sovereignty if we accept that it is a human life. So this argument does NOT rely on  whether a woman's autonomy absolute. It relies on *whose* right to bodily autonomy supersedes the other. Restriction on abortion violates a woman's right to physical autonomy, *but we can't ignore that rending another human being limb by limb is a violation of that being's autonomy*. This is a moral argument pitting one human being's life vs another. Again, an agreement can be made by most people that self-preservation when under direct threat of death or bodily harm is justifiable. This is also not hard to agree on due to the fact that both the mother *and* fetus will die if the mother dies. The course of action is unfortunate but clear in these circumstances. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if we're talking about killing a person because it'll make the mother's life more difficult- that she would face embarrassment or scrutiny, that she would have economic hardship, that she would resent the child, that she'd have to suspend her pursuit of career or education, then that's an awfully steep hill to climb. I'd say that's akin to saying that someone who murders their two year old child because that child is holding him or her back in some way is somehow justified. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, and not to belabor the point, this is coming from a standpoint that we've conceded that the fetus is a human being. If you contend that it is not, then this discussion is irrelevant. I feel like I have to keep saying this because pro-choice advocates seem to  skip over or ignore that argument for some reason. You cannot ignore that argument and push this one of bodily autonomy as the definition of human life sits squarely at the center of the debate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut there's one more rhetorical challenge to this. The pro-choicer would say something like \"It's unreasonable to expect a pregnant woman to have some kind of duty to support the fetus. You aren't forced to give your own kidney to your child if it would save their life, so it would be unreasonable to expect a woman to carry a child to term.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoo boy. Let's unpack this one. So- to the point of donating blood or organs to a child to save their life. I'd wager most parents would, even at the risk of illness or bodily harm, and many would sacrifice their life to save their child. Now of course it's not mandated to do so. I agree with that. However a parent has a *duty of care* to their children. If a parent does not feed their child and that child dies, then they would be guilty of manslaughter by negligence.    \n\n\n In this case, the *illness* would be what is killing the child. This is a bad analogy. A pregnant woman does not  have a sick child, she has a child that she needs to feed and nurture. Thus the women's sacrifice is tied to her *duty of care*. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd this, I think, is where I'll get a little political. The new postmodern millennial HATES anything that has to do with duty. They hate anything that has to do with responsibility. Not to go off topic here but this is related to the same people who work 40 hours a week, go out to dinner regularly, take Ubers on a regular basis, has a smartphone and an internet connection and is all in all living a life that is privileged by any measure compared to any other human being at any other moment in history complaining about being a \"Wage slave\" because he has to work in order to pay off the student loans that he voluntarily accepted for a degree program he voluntarily entered into.   \n\n\nThe notion that a person has duties and responsibilities seems to be noxious to these people, and the implication that some problems can't just be forgotten about, or made to go away does not sit well with them. Let's be absolutely clear here: Pregnancy doesn't just happen. It's not magic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPregnancy is the risk any person takes when they enter into a sexual relationship with another person. Life. Has. Risks. With those risks come consequences. Now of course I must carve out an exception for women who have been raped. \n\nThat should be obvious, but in cases where a woman entered into a consensual sexual relationship with a man, she *has undertaken a certain amount of risk of pregnancy.* Now we can mitigate those risks. We have condoms, birth control pills, and all matters of contraception. We even have a morning after pill, but none of those things will reduce the risk to zero. I'm not necessarily preaching abstinence here but the idea that sex is or ought to be consequence-less is stupid. People do not \"*need\"* to have sex. Except in the cases of rape, no one is forcing you to have sex. It is a decision that you make voluntarily, and with that a tacit acceptance of the risks of pregnancy.   \n\n\nThere are ways of dealing with risk. It is attractive to reduce risk through medicine and technology. The risk of driving is mitigated by seatbelts and crumple zone technology, but if you are injured, there is greater medical technology that can treat you if you're injured. The risk of pregnancy can be abated through preventative measures such as condoms and birth control, but it's one of the few risks people take in which the \"solution\" involves the potential killing of another human life. \n\n  \nSo this whole notion that a woman ought not be \"burdened\" with this duty of care is  farcical. Is it \"fair\" that only women have to worry about this risk of pregnancy? Of course it's not. It's not fair that women have menstrual cycles. It's not fair that men have to worry about testicular cancer. It's not fair that women who try to have children can't conceive.  These are all biological realities that are not just or fair or equal,  but that's life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, we only have to have this conversation if we can agree that the fetus is a human life or not. Again, if you can comfortably argue that you don't believe a fetus is a human life then by all means go with that. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on it, but *that question must be answered first as it obviates the need for other arguments.* This is where most debates about abortion go off the rails, I think. The pro-choicer can make some excellent points about women's rights, bodily autonomy, when abortions can be justified, etc, but the pro-lifer isn't going to care about *any of them* unless you can convince them that the fetus isn't a human life. If a pro-choicer is willing to concede that point, then they would be able to argue with the pro-lifer about the circumstances in which taking that life are justified. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, sorry that was long-winded. If you made it this far then thanks for reading. Honestly I just needed to get some stuff off my chest, and wanted to hear some different perspectives. Challenging your beliefs is the best way to learn, after all. I look forward to thoughtful responses!","80":"Not gonna lie it has been on my mind for a really long time, but like I really feel like if I don't write down my opinion and try like, discussing this with others, it's going to bug me.\n\nMy stance on the subject is this:\n\nI believe biologically, there are only 2 genders, male and female. Basically the two genetically determined sexes that are out there. I am marginally okay with nonbinary, although I kinda am more leaning to it's not a real thing vs. it being a real thing. As for transgenders, I believe they fall under only the two categories, and thus, there are only two genders even if you include transgenders.\n\nThis is where I'm struggling a little bit though. If we assume that gender has been separated from sex, then the possibility for there to be multiple genders does exist. I'm not wholly sure that I am okay with that, especially when I feel like some of these genders are basically so out of reach of reality that they seriously shouldn't even be considered real by anyone (although for clarification, I swear I'm an attack helicopter).\n\nJokes aside though, if again the gender and sex has been separated, I feel like nonbinary is still kind of sketch. I was watching a video the other day by Kalvin Garrah who discussed how dysphoric nonbinaries had come up to him to try to understand the viewpoints of nonbinaries. I think that if someone experiences dysphoria over being called he or she, then yes, maybe a nonbinary label is necessary to help them feel more comfortable, but I also don't think it's fair to have laws that force people to use pronouns that they don't want to use (I for one will only go so far to use they\/them. Ze\/Zir is hella stretching it, and I wouldn't ever use those in my life regardless of if someone asked me to).\n\nMy last thing about nonbinaries\/transgenders has to do with how it can be used to follow a kind of trend. Again, people who experience dysphoria are completely fine and I understand that that is a medical condition. However I feel like those people who state, \"Oh I'm more into boys stuff, so I must be a boy!\" are oversimplifying the point, and at that time, it becomes more personality than it does actual gender. My point here being is gender is somehow getting combined with personality, and it makes no sense. I've been a girl who has always liked boys toys and would probably be considered a \"tomboy,\" but I've never felt like I was a boy. I always just assumed that girls could like boys things, and I feel like that isn't how some other people view it.\n\nSo I guess my thing is is I'd like to produce a meaningful discussion between people and kind of get a feel for both sides. Keep in mind I do think people should be allowed to express themselves, but I also feel like some of those expressions are almost going too far down the rabbit hole. I would prefer to stay civil with no insults; just discussion.","81":"I'll start by saying that I think George Floyd's death was a public execution. And I think there have been countless others just like it that didnt happen to be filmed. \n\n   I'm still trying to work through exactly how to explain myself without sounding like an asshole so bear with me. As an American I've been incredibly frustrated by what what has been going on since George was murdered for a number of reasons.\n\n   First, I'm ashamed that our nation has been unable to progress past the point of racial oppression yet. I thought \"land of the free\" was our thing but we've royally fucked that up. \n    \n   Second, I think that the large majority of people have been focused on the wrong things through all of this. From the very first headlines, it was about race. Racist cops. While I do believe that those cops  how could you know that officer is racist just from that video? Maybe he's just your average psychopath and doesn't care what color neck he's kneeling on. \n    \n   My point is that the media turns it into a conflict right off the bat. Black vs White. Why isn't the headline:  \n'OUR BLACK COUNTRYMEN ARE STILL BEING MURDERED BY PEOPLE WHO TOOK AN OATH TO PROTECT AND SERVE THEM, WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GONNA DO??'\n   \n  That strikes me as the most important part, ghat a government would permit the murder of its citizens for any reason at all? Or am I missing something? \n  \n   But what are people arguing about? Black lives matter vs all lives matter, looters vs protesters, the bootlickers are yelling about terrorists, people are doing their \"post a black square to end racism\" challenges, arguing about whether or not you should block freeways, etc etc. \n\n   I haven't heard the topics of police reform, how to change the structure of our system so this doesn't keep happening, how to better train officers, and things like that being brought up in days. (Other than by you fine people). Aren't those the real solutions? Why isn't that all we're focused on? \n\n   I think it's because the media presents it to us as a conflict, and immediately destroys our chances of really uniting our efforts. They get us fighting amongst ourselves, next thing you know stuff is on fire, ANTIFA shows up and people start getting shot. Then it happens again and the cycle repeats itself, no chance of progress. \n\n   I think until we accept that our federal and state governments have failed us entirely, and do not have any of our best interests in mind, regardless of race, there can be no progress. \n \n   History will show that the ruling elite have always been playing a different game by a different set of rules than the rest of us. Rarely has a government sacrificed it's own gain for the gain and prosperity of it's people. Black people have had the extreme misfortune of being the US government's slaves, punching bags, and scapegoats for the last few centuries. Still being used to keep the prison industry booming, still being used for free labor. Still being abused, as diversion tactic to distract the masses from the bigger picture. \n\n  History will also show that scared and angry people are easily manipulated and controlled. You can call it a conspiracy theory, and I hope it is, but I do believe that our government is waging a war against our personal freedoms. Not the facade of a government and the puppets they let us vote on, but the faceless lifers that pull the strings. \n\n  This isn't the first time we've let ourselves be pulled off course from the source of the problem, and if we continue to let it happen nothing will change. And things need to change. Attacking eachother doesn't help, attacking racist cops who just work for some other racist cop who works for a sociopathic mayor that works for a power hungry whoever, also doesn't help. \n\n   We have an archaic, exploitable system that needs a hard reset and overhaul. It's the right and the responsibility of the American people to stand against tyranny, and it cant be done one police station or crooked senator at a time. \n\n   This is just my thoughts at the moment.\n\nTL;DR: government bad\n\nEdit: typos","82":"I live in China and i recently discovered that the age is 14 here and the rest of the world have a very very different age of consent.

The numbers show no big deal. Only a very small percentage of people are dying.\n\nLet's put on our thinking caps. When fire losses or crime statistics are low, people start to think fire departments or police aren't needed because the statistics show very low numbers. Hmm. As a retired firefighter I can tell you this, the low numbers show we are doing a good job. The low numbers of fire losses are because we prevent many fires but also because we keep most fires from spreading. IMAGINE what happens when the little fires aren't put out quickly and efficiently. A fire we can put out with an extinguisher would destroy a building or a whole block if we weren't there. Do you get that?\n\nNow apply that line of thinking to Covid 19. Why are the numbers low by percentage? Is it because it isn't a problem or is it because the measures put in place are working. IMAGINE if those measures weren't in place.\n\nDon't spout off about Chicken Little if you don't consider the doctors and scientists have told us what we need to do and they are correct.\n\nYou have to be very careful of listening to media people putting their \"spin\" onto situations because they only ask you to look at one hand and not look at what the other hand is hiding.
